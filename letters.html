If you would like a recommendation letter, send the following to
<tt>katherine stjohn AT hunter cuny edu</tt>:

<ul>
	<li> Your full name (and any name changes),
	<li> The course and semester for which I was your instructor,
	<li> Your resume,
	<li> A description (and webpage link) to the program to which you are applying,
	<li> Any required forms for the program (with your sections and signature completed),
	<li> A brief description of why you are applying to the program, and
	<li> The deadline for submitting the letter.
</ul>

If I have written a letter for you in the past, I can usually send
a new letter via email within a week. <br>
For new letters or those that
must be submitted on paper, allow at least two weeks.

<p>
If this is the first time you are requesting recommendation letters, here
are some things to consider:
<ul>
	<li>  When choosing someone to write a letter for you, consider how you did
		in the class:  Did you do well?  Did you attend and participate in class?
		Your letter will be stronger if the instructor can talk about how engaged
		and how well you did in the course.
	<li>  A standard question on the form is:  how long have you known the applicant
		and in what capacity?
		When possible, choose a letter writer who has taught you in multiple classes
		or has been a mentor over several semesters.
	<li>  Choose your letter writers to fit the application.  For example, if you are applying
		to divinity school to become a minister, there are questions about your religion
		and faith on the recommendation
		form  which a computer science professor cannot answer.
		Similarly, if you are
		applying for graduate school in the sciences, your swim instructor will probably
		have difficulties discussing your ability to complete academic work.
	<li>  If applying to a doctoral program, a standard question of a letter writer
		is how well will the student perform.  This is difficult to answer if  the
		letter writer is still a doctoral student (many CUNY adjuncts and teaching assistants are
		currently
		working on their doctoral degrees).  In this situation, try to find letter writers who
		have doctorates or a strong research background.
	<li>  Consider waiving your right to read the letter.  This allows the letter writer
		to write a more open letter and is viewed more favorably by the institutions requesting
		letters.
	<li>  If someone who you ask for a letter suggests that you ask someone else,
		do so!  This suggestion comes up when 1) letter writers do not have time to
		complete the letter, or 2) think someone else would be able to write you a
		stronger letter.

</ul>
