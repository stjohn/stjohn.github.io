<h3>Python Recap</h3>

Using LeetCode & HackerRank

Talk through HackerRank challenges

The textbook has an excellent overview of data structure and algorithms as well as a concise review of Python topics.  Written by the same team who wrote the CSCI 127 textbook, it has interactive code windows and exercises throughout the text.  Work through the following sections of the <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds3/index.html">textbook</a>:
<ul>
    <li>Sections 1.1-1.6 (Overview of Data Structure & Algorithms)</li>
    <li>Section 1.7 (Basic Python)</li>
    <li>Section 1.8.1 (Built-in Atomic/Primitive Data Types)</li>
    <li>Section 1.10 (Control Structures)</li>
    <li>Section 1.12 (Defining Functions)</li>  
</ul>
(The other sections of the first chapter are also important, but we will cover those later in the term.)
