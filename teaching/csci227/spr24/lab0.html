<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Explain class:  focus on analytic reasoning and problem solving.  Designed for computer science minors, but others welcome.  Surveys the core topics in data structures and algorithms with an emphasis on solving problems and less time on the theory (for more on both, see the programming sequence for majors:  CSci 135/235/335).

<h3>Things To Do Now</h3>

Before the first lecture, here's some things to do to prepare for the upcoming semester.  More details in the subsections below:

<ul>
    <li>Set up your Python programming environment.</li>
    <li>Set up accounts for the software platforms that we will use this term 
        (Blackboard, Gradescope, LeetCode, HackerRank, and GitHub).
    </li>
    <li>Refresh your knowledge of Python learned in the introductory course.</li>
    <li>Complete Classwork 0 on Gradescope.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Python Programming Environment</h4>

<li>If you don't have a laptop or home machine, reach out the Office of Student Affairs.  Hunter College is committed to providing students the resources they need to succeed.  FIND LINKS</li>
<li>Set up the programming environment or your laptop or home machine.  While you can use online environments, if you have a machine, it's good practice for the future to use an integrated development environment (IDE).  An all-purpose one that works well with Python is VSCODE.   ADD LINKS</li>

<h4>Access for Software Platforms</h4>

<li>Set up accounts for the software platforms we will use this term:
    <ul>
        <li>Blackboard:  this is set up automatically about 24 hours after registration.  If this course does not appear on your Blackboard list of courses, doublecheck your CUNYFirst course registration for the Spring. </li>
        <li>Gradescope:  this one we set up for you, based on whose registered on 24 January.  If this course is not appearing in your Gradescope course list or you would like to use a different email address (we use the one in Blackboard), send us email with your full name, EmplID, and preferred email.</li>
        <li>LeetCode:</li>
        <li>HackerRank:</li>
        <li>Github:</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Introductory Python Recap</h4>

The textbook has an excellent overview of data structure and algorithms as well as a concise review of Python topics.  Written by the same team who wrote the CSCI 127 textbook, it has interactive code windows and exercises throughout the text.  Work through the following sections of the <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds3/index.html">textbook</a>:
<ul>
    <li>Sections 1.1-1.6 (overview of data structure & algorithms)</li>
    <li>Section 1.7 (basic Python)</li>
    <li>Section 1.8.1 (built-in atomic/primative data types)</li>
    <li>Section 1.10 (control structures)</li>
    <li>Section 1.11 (Defining Functions)</li>  
</ul>
(The other sections of the first chapter are also important, but we will cover those later in the term.)

<h4>Classwork 0</h4>

There is in-class work submitted each lecture.  The first work, "Classwork 0", is a quick on-line exercise, based on the <a href="syl.html">syllabus</a>.  It is available on Gradescope on 24 January.
