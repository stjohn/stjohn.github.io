<h3>Interactive Graphics</h3>

<p>We will use the graphics package developed for the book. If you have not already
downloaded the <tt>graphics.py</tt>, work through the directions in <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>.

<p>The first program for today is <tt>click.py</tt> from the book (downloadable
from <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/">the book's website)</a>.
Try running the program (remember you need to have the <tt>graphics.py</tt> file in the 
same directory.  What does it do?  Let's look at the program:

<ul>
	<li> The first lines have a comment with the name of the program and ask that python load
		the graphics module:
<pre>
# click.py
from graphics import *

</pre>
	<li>  These lines give the name of the function we are defining (<tt>main()</tt>
	and make a new variable, called <tt>win</tt>, that holds a graphics window object:
<pre>
def main():
    win = GraphWin("Click Me!")

</pre>

	<li>  Next, we have a definite loop that prints out the point the user clicked.  The
		point is saved in a variable called <tt>p</tt>.
		The loop repeats 10 times.  After the end of the function definition, the function
		<tt>main()</tt> is invoked:
<pre>
for i in range(10):
	p = win.getMouse()
	print("You clicked at:", p.getX(), p.getY())

main()
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Let's modify this program in several ways:
<ul>
	<li> Allow the user to click 20 times instead of 10.
	<li> Show the points that the user clicks on the screen.<br>
		(Hint:  look in the lecture notes for how other objects are drawn on the screen.  The 
		same idea works for points.)
	<li> Modify your program so that it will connect-the-dots that the user clicks upon.
</ul>

<p> This last one is more challenging.  To draw a line you will need to remember the point 
from the click before.  Let's make a new variable called <tt>oldPoint</tt> to save the point
and use it in the loop body to draw a line:

<pre>
	p = win.getMouse()
	print("You clicked at:", p.getX(), p.getY())
	Line(oldPoint,p).draw(win)
	oldPoint = p
</pre>

If your loop body to this, you will get an error.  What is it?  What is missing?  Remember
you cannot use a variable until it has a value.  So, before your loop, let's give <tt>oldPoint</tt>
a value:
<pre>
	oldPoint = Point(0,0)
	for i in range(10):
		...
</pre>
Now what happens when you run it?  Where does your line start?  Try it several times.  Does it 
always start in the same place?  To have it start where the user first clicked, we need to get
that value before we draw the line.  Here is one way to do this:
<pre>
def main():
    win = GraphWin("Click Me!")
    oldPoint = win.getMouse()
    for i in range(10):
	p = win.getMouse()
	print("You clicked at:", p.getX(), p.getY())
	Line(oldPoint,p).draw(win)
	oldPoint = p
	p.draw(win)
</pre>
