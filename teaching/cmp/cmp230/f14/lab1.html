<p>
Today's lab will focus on using the Blackboard system and simple programs
in Python.  <br>Software tools needed:  web browser and Python IDLE programming 
environment.

<h3>Using Blackboard</h3>

<p>This course will use the on-line Blackboard system for submitting 
work electronically. Blackboard should be accessible 
through your CUNY portal account (<a href="http://portal.cuny.edu">http://portal.cuny.edu</a>). 
If you have not used Blackboard in the past, information is available at the Computer Center
(<a href="http://www.lehman.edu/itr/blackboard.php">http://www.lehman.edu/itr/blackboard.php</a>). 
They can set up your account and have information sheets about using the system.
<!--In addition:
	<blockquote>
	(From Information Technology Center mass email, 1/28/11:)
	<p>
  	During the first week of the semester, Monday (1/31) through Friday (2/4), 
  	we will again provide Walk-In Blackboard Assistance, from 10:00-noon and 2:00-4:00 
  	in Carman Hall B-38.  We will staff this room with our Blackboard team, and 
  	students with login or other Blackboard difficulties can come by for help.
<br>
	After hearing from many of you that students need more assistance with 
	learning Blackboard, the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Online Education 
	has created a Student Blackboard Orientation which students (and faculty) can 
	access by clicking on a new ONLINE INFO tab on the top header of Blackboard.
<br>
	This Blackboard Orientation contains useful information and helpful hints to 
	introduce students to Blackboard's features, and it contains tutorials (like 
	how to post in the discussion board right inside the orientation's discussion 
	board!) along with links to useful sites, tech support information and necessary 
	software.

  	</blockquote>
-->

<p>We will be using Blackboard for in-class quizzes, submitting programs, and 
posting grades.  Quizzes and submitting programs are done via the <tt>Content</tt>
menu (left hand side of <tt>Home</tt> screen).  


<p>
<b>Timing Out:</b> If the system times out and locks your attempt (happens rarely 
when the browser or PC crashes), send email to an instructor so they
can clear the attempt so you can try again.

<h3>Using Python</h3>

<p>We will be using the IDLE programming environment for Python.  On the desktop,
there is an <tt>Idle</tt> icon.  Click the icon to launch idle.  In the shell
window that pops up, try typing some of the commands that we did in lecture (also
from the textbook):
<pre>
	print("Hello, world!")
	print()
	def greet(person):
	   print("Hello", person)
	greet("world")
</pre>
(Indentation does matter, so, remember to indent the <tt>print</tt> line, using TABs, 
so that it is included in the <tt>greet()</tt> function.)

<p>Next, let's write a program that will greet someone 5 times.  Instead of using
the shell window (which lets us try things immediately), let's use a text window, where
we can save our program for later.  The basic structure
of the program will be:
<pre>
#Define our function
	#Have a loop that repeats 5 times
	#Inside that loop, greet that person 
</pre>
Copy the above lines into a new text window.  Save, using the name, <tt>greetLoop.py</tt>
to your USB drive.  If you try to run your program, it will currently give an error since there's nothing for it to do, 
since all the lines are proceeded by the `#' and treated as a comment.

<p>
Let's fill in a bit more of the program:
<pre>
#Define our function
def greetLoop(person):
	#Have a loop that repeats 5 times
	#Inside that loop, greet that person 
	print("Hello", person)
</pre>
Save your revised program and run it (using the "Run module" from the run menu or F5 key).  
At the shell, if you type:
<pre>
greetLoop("World")
</pre>
how many times does the message get printed?  Why?

<p>
Let's add in the missing loop, to make it print out the multiple times:
<pre>
#Define our function
def greetLoop(person):
	#Have a loop that repeats 5 times
	for i in range(5):
	#Inside that loop, greet that person 
	print("Hello", person)
</pre>
Save your revised program and run it (using the "Run module" from the run menu or F5 key).  
At the shell, if you type:
<pre>
greetLoop("World")
</pre>
how many times does the message get printed?  What went wrong?  A loop only repeats
statements indented below it.  Since our print statement wasn't indented, it decided
we had an `empty loop' followed by a simple print statement.  To include the
print statement in the loop, we add indentation:
<pre>
#Define our function
def greetLoop(person):
	#Have a loop that repeats 5 times
	for i in range(5):
		#Inside that loop, greet that person 
		print("Hello", person)
</pre>
Save your revised program and run it (using the "Run module" from the run menu or F5 key).  
At the shell, if you type:
<pre>
greetLoop("World")
</pre>
how many times does the message get printed?

<p>Change your program so the message is printed 25 times.  

<p>A common thing to include in your Python file is a call (or "invocation") to
the function at the end of the file:
<pre>
#Define our function
def greetLoop(person):
	#Have a loop that repeats 5 times
	for i in range(5):
		#Inside that loop, greet that person 
		print("Hello", person)

greetLoop("Herbert")		
</pre>
When you run the program ("Run module" or F5), the program will be loaded and
the function is called automatically.  In this case, it will call the function,
<tt>greetLoop</tt> with the parameter <tt>"Herbert"</tt>.  If you would like 
to call the function again, you type the name of the function with the desired
parameters, at the shell prompt.



<p> With the remaining time, work on the homework problems.

<h3>Using Python on Your Computer</h3>

The Python programming language and IDLE environment are freely available
for many platforms from <a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a>.  
For this class, we are using <b>Python 3</b>.  Many features of the language
(including the syntax of <tt>print</tt> statements) changed between the second and third
version, so, you must use the Python 3 for submitting programs.
