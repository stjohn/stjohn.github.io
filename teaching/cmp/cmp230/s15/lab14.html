This lab works with associative arrays (dictionaries).

In the text, Zelle develops a <a href="../f14/wordfreq.py">program</a> to count the word
frequency in a file.  For example, if you run the program on itself, you will get:
<pre>
This program analyzes word frequency in a file
and prints a report on the n most frequent words.

</pre>
To count the number of words, he uses an associative array, or dictionary.  These
are similar to arrays, but only store entries where they are needed.  For our 
counting of words above, instead of having an entry for every word in the English
language, we set up a dictionary:

<pre>
    counts = {}
</pre>
It starts out empty, but as we encounter new words, we add to the count for
those words in a similar fashion as for lists or arrays:
<pre>
    counts[w] = counts.get(w,0) + 1
</pre>
After we have processed the entire file, we turn our dictionary into a list 
that we can sort and print out the <tt>n</tt> items that have occurred most:
<pre>
    items = list(counts.items())
    items.sort()
    items.sort(key=byFreq, reverse=True)
    for i in range(n):
        word, count = items[i]
        print("{0:<15}{1:>5}".format(word, count))
</pre>

<p>
Let's try this on another file <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2013/denero-muralidharan-trends/data/sandwich.txt">sandwich.txt</a> 
(from the <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/">nifty program</a> developed by 
John DeNero and Aditi Muralidharan).  This file is a collection of tweets collected
over 24 hours, that contain the word sandwich (the format follows <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a>
used by <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>).  When we run our program 
again, with a small change to the <tt>open()</tt> so it can handle the extra characters
that occur in tweets:
<pre>
    text = open(fname,'r',encoding='utf8').read()	#Added in encoding to handle tweets
</pre>
we can print out the most common words:
<pre>
This program analyzes word frequency in a file
and prints a report on the n most frequent words.

Why so many numbers?  Let's look at the first couple of lines of <tt>sandwich.txt</tt>

</pre>
Each line has a lot of additional information, in addition to the twitter message.  
The first numbers are the location, a callback (which we will ignore), the date and time, 
and then lastly the tweet itself.  

<p>
Let's break up the information and create two different dictionaries:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>counts</tt> will hold the count of words found in the tweets (the 3rd and last field of 
	each line, if we separate by tabs), and
	<li> <tt>hours</tt> will hold the count of how many tweets occurred each hour (the end of 
	the second field of each line, if we separate by tabs).
</ul>
Since we're treating different parts of each line differently, let's traverse the file
line-by-line and create a <tt>text</tt> string variable that will hold the tweets (that
can be processed as before) and a dictionary of the hours and frequency that tweets 
occur.

<p>First, we'll go through the file and split each line into fields, keeping only the
hour that the tweet occurred and the tweeted message:
<pre>
    infile = open(fname,'r',encoding='utf8')

    #Split up the lines to have the number of events each hour,
    #   and put the tweets in text to be processed as before.
    text = ""
    times = {}
    for lines in infile.readlines():
        fields = lines.split("\t")
        text = text + fields[3]
        time = fields[2].split()[1]
        hour = time[0:2]
        times[hour] = times.get(hour,0) + 1
        print(hour, fields[3])	#Print for testing, remove before running final program
</pre>

<p>
Try running the <a href="../f14/tweetFreq.py">program</a> with the test print above.
Then comment out the print, since it's not needed once you've verified it
is getting the right fields.

<p>
Next, we'll print out the hours and the number of tweets in the dictionary for
each hour.  We'll follow the same format as Zelle used for counting words:

<pre>
    #Print out when tweets occur:
    items = list(times.items())
    items.sort()
    for item in items:
        #Each item is a list of the key and the associated entry:
        print("At hour", item[0], ", there were", item[1], "tweets.")

</pre>

At what hour do most people tweet about sandwiches?  Try your program on the other
tweets collected at the <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2013/denero-muralidharan-trends/data">nifty
site</a>.  Each file there is labelled by the common topic (i.e. "soup", "obama", or "party").
