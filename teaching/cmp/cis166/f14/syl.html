<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Students are expected to learn both the material covered in 
class and the material in the textbook and other assigned reading. Completing homework 
is an essential part of the learning experience. Students should review topics from 
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
are responsible for knowing and following Lehman's 
<a href="http://www.lehman.edu/academics/arts-humanities/documents/CUNYPolicyonAcademicIntegrity.pdf">Academic Integrity Policy</a>,
(available from the
Undergraduate Bulletin, Graduate Bulletin, or the Office of Academic
Standards and Evaluations). <br>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice President of
Student Affairs. 

<p><b>Homework:</b>  Programming exercises are posted on the class
website, usually two weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture.  Note that as the semester progresses, the
programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to
complete.  To receive full credit for a program, the program must 
perform correctly, must include comments, and be written in good style.
<!--Approximately 12 programs will be graded thoroughly and returned with 
comments.  The top 10
grades will be counted for the homework score.-->
<b>No late homework is accepted.</b>

<p><b>Quizzes:</b> At every class meeting, there will be an in-class quiz based
on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and laboratory 
exercises.  
<ul>
	<li> As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.  
	<li> All quizzes must be taken during class time, and <b>there are no make-up quizzes.</b>  
		Instead, we will drop up to three missed quizzes
		(if you take all quizzes, we will drop the lowest three scores).
	<li> The top 25 (out of 28 possible) quiz scores will count towards the quiz score in the final grade.
		If you do better on the final examination than on the top 25 quizzes, we will replace up
		to 5 quizzes with your final exam grade.  
	<li> All lab and chapter quizzes are open book, open notes, and you may use the Python shell.
	<li> There are two different kinds of programming quizzes 
		(that test your mastery of the previous week's programming assignment):
		<ul>
			<li> The first kind
		are on-line, and you may use your books, notes, and the Python shell.
			<li> The second kind are on paper (echoing the style of the final exam).  For these, you may
		<b>not</b> use your notes, books, or computer. 
		</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is required.  You make take the final at
any time it is being offered, and sign-up sheets will be available in early 
November for you to choose your preferred time.  The times for the
final are available at the <a href="../f14.html">class webpage</a>.

<p><b>Grades:</b>  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Problem Sets: 15% </li>
      <li>Quizzes: 50%       </li>
      <li>Final Exam: 35%       </li>      
    </ul>
  </li>

	<p> 
	You must take and pass the final to pass the course.

<h3>Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities</h3>

<p><b>Textbook:</b> <i>Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science</i> by John Zelle
(ISBN 1887902996).  Approximate price: $40 (available on-line from 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> & <a href="http://www.powells.com">Powells</a>).


<p>
<b>Technology:</b> This course uses the <b>Python</b> programming language available from 
<a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a>.  It
is available on the department computers in Gillet Hall. 


<p><b>Computer Access:</b> Part of this course will use university
computer laboratories. These machines are for work related to
this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the
department and on-campus. Misusing university computers could
result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term, making
it exceedingly difficult to complete this course.

<p>
<b>Tutoring:</b> Departmental tutoring is available in the Math Lab on the 2nd floor of Gillet Hall.
