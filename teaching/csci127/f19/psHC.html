	<li > <b>HC 1:  Neighborhoods of the CitiBike Expansion</b>  <b style="float:right">Due Date: 3 September</b>  <br>

	<p>
	<img src="http://d21xlh2maitm24.cloudfront.net/nyc/pr351-19-citibike-expansion.png?mtime=20190717103528" height = 600>

	<p>  Throughout the semester, we will focus on the upcoming <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/blog/major-citi-bike-expansion-map-revealed">expansion of CitiBike</a>:

		<blockquote>
			The de Blasio Administration joined Lyft to today announce the boundaries of the planned expansion of Citi Bike over the next five years, which will bring the nation's largest bike share system to a larger and more economically diverse range of communities. Last November, the City and Lyft announced an agreement in which Lyft would invest $100 million to grow and strengthen the system, doubling the size of its service area and tripling the number of bikes over the next five years. The third phase of Citi Bike's expansion will bring Citi Bike to all of Manhattan, as well as into the Bronx, and deeper into Brooklyn and Queens.
		</blockquote>

  and how best to allocate the new bicycles to the next targeted neighborhoods in the South Bronx, Upper Manhattan, and Queens.

  <p>To begin, pick a neighborhood (i.e. choose one and sign up on Blackboard).  Create a single page summary of your neighborhood that includes:
	<ul>
		<li> Name of the neighborhood (include in the title),
		<li> The zip code(s) of your neighborhood,
		<li> The census tracts encompassing your neighborhood (see <a href="https://geomap.ffiec.gov/FFIECGeocMap/GeocodeMap1.aspx">Census Tract Finder</a>),
		<li> A map of New York City with your neighborhood highlighted,
		<li> An photo or image that captures your neighborhood,
		<li> The demographics of your neighborhood, and
		<li> The distance of your neighborhood to Federal Hall and to Empire State Building.
	</ul>
	These will be posted in the Blackboard honors section site and form the basis of your showcase presentation (teams for the group projects will be formed based on the adjacency of the neighborhood chosen).

	<p><i>Note:  upload a .pdf to the assignment <tt>HC 1.</tt> in the honors section of <a href="http://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>.  Unlike the Python code, it is not automatically graded. </i></p>

  <li > <b>HC 2:  Neighborhood Rankings
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 9 September</b>  <br>

		<p> Working in pairs or triples, design a ranking for most desirable features of a neighborhood.

		<p>There are multiple rankings of New York City Neighborhoods.  For example,
		<ul>
			<li> <a href="https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/search/best-neighborhoods/m/new-york-city-metro-area/">Niche</a>,

			<li> <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/crime-safety-report/ranking">DNA Info's rankings</a>,
			<li> <a href="https://www.brickunderground.com/live/best-nyc-neighborhoods-for-college-grads-2016">Brick Underground</a>,
			<li><a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2017/9/19/16329796/nyc-best-neighborhood-transit-walk-bike-score">Curbed's Walkable Neighborhoods</a>,
			<li> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/where-should-you-actually-live-in-new-york-city?utm_term=.dvk8EJ3Ne#.clDxXrwq4">BuzzFeed</a>,
			<li> <a href="https://www.streetadvisor.com/search/cities-in-new-york-city-new-york">Street Advisor</a>
		</ul>


		With your group:
		<ul>
			<li> Assess what these rankings have in common and how they differ.
			<li> Which ranking do you favor and why?
			<li> What qualities make a neighborhood desirable place to live?
			<li> Collate a list of the three most important.
		</ul>

		<p>Submit a .pdf file containing your assessment of the rankings and the three most desirable qualities.  You should use complete sentences, compare and contrast the rankings above, and justify the three qualities that your group thought most important.
		</p>



	<hr>
		<li > <b>HC 3:  Walking in NYC Neighborhoods
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 16 September</b>  <br>

		<br>
		<p><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.walkscore.com" width="80%" height="400" ></iframe>


		<p>  Urban planner, Jeff Speck, argues that if a city succeeds at
		being walkable (and by extension, bikeable), it excels at having a high quality of life (see his
		<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_speck_the_walkable_city">TED talk</a>).

		<p> Working in pairs or triples, analyze his argument in terms of five neighborhoods in New York City and the ranking you determined in HC 2.  For five of the neighborhoods chosen by class (1-page summaries from HC 1 are available on Blackboard), determine the following:
		<ul>
			<li> Rank the five neighborhoods by your ranking from HC 2.  Explain how you determined the neighborhoods ranked (you can have ties, but you need to justify the rankings, even in the case of ties).
			<li> How did the 5 neighborhoods do in terms of walkability (order the neighborhoods by their <a href= "https://www.walkscore.com">walk scores</a>).

		</ul>

		<p> Does your ranking concur with ranking the neighborhoods by walkability?  Justify your answer.

		<p>Submit a .pdf file analyzing the your rankings and walkability of five neighborhoods chosen for the class.  You should use complete sentences and justify your answers with data.

		<li > <b>HC 4:  Cost of Commuting
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 23 September</b>  <br>


		<br>
		<p><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling ="no" src="https://project.wnyc.org/transit-time/index.html#40.76700,-73.96361,14,961" width="80%" height="600" ></iframe>

		<p> FiveThirtyEight analyzed the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-will-pay-56-a-month-to-trim-a-minute-off-their-commute/">cost of commuting</a> in terms of the extra New Yorkers were willing to pay to lessen their commute.  <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/subway-commute-time-impact/">StreetEasy</a> did a similar analysis, measuring from given subway stops (and includes a lovely Tableaux map-- scroll down).

		<p> How will availability of CitiBikes affect housing prices?  To narrow down the analysis, we will focus on the distance to two landmarks:  Empire State Building (as a proxy for midtown) and Federal Hall (for the financial district) and 3 locations.  You may find <a href="https://project.wnyc.org/transit-time/">WNYC Transit Time</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> useful, as well as
		<a href="https://citymapper.com/nyc?lang=en">CityMapper</a>.

    Pick, at random, three <a href="https://streeteasy.com/rentals">rentals</a> in your neighborhood.

		<ul>
			<li> Compute the <b>shortest commute driving</b> to the Empire State Building or Federal Hall for those locations.  Assume that you are arriving at 8:30am on a weekday.
			<li> Compute the <b>shortest commute by public transit</b> to the Empire State Building or Federal Hall for those locations.  Assume that you are arriving at 8:30am on a weekday and that you walk to the nearest station.
      		<li> Compute the <b>shortest commute by public transit, <u>assuming you bike between the apartment and station</u>,</b> to the Empire State Building or Federal Hall for those locations.  Assume that you are arriving at 8:30am on a weekday.
		</ul>

		<p> Using the analysis from FiveThirtyEight, predict what the tunnel closure will do to the prices of your three chosen apartments. Justify your answer.

		<p>Submit a .pdf file analyzing the time and cost of commuting of your neighborhood.  You should use complete sentences and justify your answers with data.

	<li > <b>HC 5:  Highlighted Map
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 2 October</b>  <br>


    <p><img src="../f18/hunterSatMap.png" height = 300>
    <img src="../f18/hiLight.png" height = 300>

		<p>
    For this program, we will create a highlighted map around centered on your neighborhood, with the region within about a 1/4 mile box at full brightness, the region that outside that box at 50% brightness.

		<p> To do this:
		<ul>
			<li> Create a .png file of a satellite map, centered on your neighborhood (Google maps works well for this, but you can use any mapping site to create your base map).
			<li> Write a Python program that reads in an image and saves the image to another file.  Run your program to make sure the reading and saving of an image works.
      <li> Set the upper region of the image to 50% brightness (hint:  uses slices and see example in Lecture 3 and 4).  Run your program to make sure it has dimmed up the upper region and adjust to get the correct dimenssions.
      <li> Set the lower region of the image to 50% brightness (hint:  think about what negative numbers mean as indices).  Run your program and fix any bugs.
			<li> Next, dim the side regions (hint:  think about what parts of the image have not been dimmed and change only those regions.)
		</ul>

		<p> Submit your answer as a .pdf file to gradescope.


  <hr>
  <li > <b>HC 6: Neighborhood Grid</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 7 October</b>  <br>

  <p><img src="ridgewood_grid.png" height = 300>

  <p> To determine where to place new bike stations, the NYC Department of Transportation, divided each region into 1000-square-foot grid (see p 25 of the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/bike-share-outreach-report.pdf">NYC Bike Share Report</a> for a sample grid).

  <p>Take an image of your neighborhood and overlay it with a 1000 square-foot grid.

  <p> To do this:
  <ul>
    <li> Create a .png file of a map centered on your neighborhood (Google maps works well for this, you may look at the 1000ft bar in the lower right corner to determine how many squares in your image. Make sure your neighborhood is hilighted on the map).
    <li> Write a Python program that reads in the image.
    <li> Calculate your grid-interval based on how many 1000ft squares fit in your image.
    <li> Change the color of each row and column in your image at the grid-interval you have determied to turn it black. (hint:  uses slices and see example with intervals -- skipping rows/columns with step -- in Lecture 4).
    <li> Save the image to another file.
  </ul>

<p> Your answer should have your image on the first page and the code you used to generate the image on the next page.  Submit your answer as a .pdf file to gradescope.

  <li > <b>HC 7: Station Density & Locations</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 15 October</b>  <br>

	<p>
	<img src="bikeShareStationFeatures.png" height=600>
	<br><small>(Workshop Table Graphic, <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/bike-share-outreach-report.pdf">NYC Bike Share Report</a>, p 26.)</small>
	<br>


	<p> Where should bike stations go in your neighborhood?  The criteria outlined in the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/bike-share-outreach-report.pdf">NYC Bike Share Report</a> aimed to have at least one station per every 1000-square-feet and be near destinations such as train/bus stops, museums, shopping, and parks (see graphic above).

	<p> Identify 3-5 possible locations that would be a good location for a bike station in each grid location (include the cross streets or short description if mid-block, as well as which side-- such as "north east corner of the intersection") and a short justification of why that location would be good.

  	<p> Your answer should contain your grid (from HC 6) and a itemized list with an entry of the locations for each region in the grid.
	<p> Submit your answer as a .pdf file to gradescope.

	<li > <b>HC 11: Citibike Map</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 11 November</b>  <br>


	<hr>




	<li > <b>HC 12: Catchments for Proposed  Stations</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 18 November</b>  <br>


      <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a> divides a region based on the distance to a set of input points.  This simple idea has many applications, one of the most famous was the <a href="http://johnsnowbicentenary.lshtm.ac.uk/about-john-snow/">work of John Snow</a> to study the 1854 cholera outbreak.  Our focus will be on mapping access to public resources and transit.

      <p>The sample program builds a Voronoi diagram will be for libraries across the city (using the
      library data set from  <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Library/p4pf-fyc4">NYC Library Locations</a> (download as CSV file).
      Our map highlights the regions closest to each library:

      <p>
      <iframe src="../../seminar4/s17/libVor.html" style="width: 95%; height: 700px" name="internal"></iframe>

      <p>To make our map, we
      <ol>
      	<li> First take library locations and calculate the Voronoi diagram (using the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Voronoi.html">scipy</a> package).
      	<li> While going row by row to get the library locations, add markers to the map (we're adding them as separate markers, not a MarkerCluster, since we don't want them to collapse when zooming out).
      	<li> Show the plot in a matplotlib window to make sure its working (note:  if you have a separate matplotlib window you may need to close it, since the rest of the program is waiting until it's done to continue).
      	<li> Then write out the locations as a geojson file (using the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geojson">geojson</a>).
      	<li> Load the regions in as a geoJSON layer in folium.

      </ol>

      <p>If you are using anaconda (either spyder, idle3, or jupyter), the scipy and matplotlib packages are included.  To install geojson, type at a terminal window:
      <pre>
      	pip install geojson
      </pre>

      <p> The program, <a href="../../seminar4/s17/makeVor.py">makeVor.py</a>, is a bit rambling, but contains all the steps above (a better design would be to split into separate functions or files for the different tasks).  Try running it on the library dataset (assumes that it is in the same folder as the program).

      <p>Note that it does very well in dense regions but has odd behavior on the edges of the map since we didn't include in the <tt>.json</tt> file any point at infinity and didn't clip the maps to the city boundaries.

      <p>Modify the program to make to make two Voronoi diagrams:
      <ul>
      	<li> Make a Voronoi diagram of the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49">NYC subway stations</a>
          (download as CSV).  (Despite the name of the file suggesting that it's from 2010, the file contains the new Second Avenue Subway stops).
        <li> Make a Voronoi diagram of the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49">NYC subway stations</a>
            <b>without the L-train stations that east of the tunnel</b> in the input file.
      </ul>

		<p> Submit a .pdf file with a screen capture image of your first HTML map (with all subway stations) and your second HTML map (without L-train stations east of the tunnel).  For each map, center the view on your station.

	<hr>

	<li > <b>HC 13: Project Webpage</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 25 November</b>  <br>

		<p> Submit the URL of your group presentation (the two slides for the presentation)  as part of a .pdf file.  If you have plans to add more to the website, include in the .pdf file any changes you have planned but didn't have a chance to enter yet.

	<hr>

	<li > <b>HC 14: Draft Presentations</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 2 December</b>  <br>

		<p> Submit the slides of your group presentation (two slides) as  a .pdf file.  Your slides should include who is on the team, the neighborhood you chose, and a brief description of your solution to how much additional housing, and what additional services would be needed.

	<hr>

	<li > <b>HC 15: Feedback Forms</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 6 December</b>  <br>

        <p><img height=300 src="csci127HonorsF18.jpg">

		<p> (This is included for completeness, since the forms will be passed out and returned in section on 6 December.  After you have commented on others group presentations, we will distribute the forms, so that groups can use these to improve their slides and webpages for the final presentation the following week. )
