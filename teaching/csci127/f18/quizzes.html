<h2><br>
Quiz Information<br>CSci 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2018<br><br>
</h2>
</div>

<div>
At every recitation, there will be an in-class quiz on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and laboratory 
exercises.  
<ul>
	<li> As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
	as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.  
	<li> All quizzes must be taken during class time, and <b>there are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).
	<li> All computer-based quizzes are open book, open notes, and you may use the Python shell and C++ programming environment.
	<li> For the paper-based quizzes, you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc.).

	<li> If you miss your assigned recitation, you may take a quiz during another section before the deadline, subject to availability and instructor's permission.
</ul>

<h3>Using Blackboard</h3>

<p>This course will use the on-line Blackboard system for in-class quizzes and posting grades. Blackboard should be accessible 
through your CUNY First account (see Hunter <a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/it/blackboard/blackboard-information-page">ICIT Blackboard page</a> for directions on using the system and how to get help).
