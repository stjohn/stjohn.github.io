	<li > <b>HC 1:  Neighborhoods of the L-Train Stations</b>  <b style="float:right">Due Date: 7 September</b>  <br>

	<p>  Throughout the semester, we will focus on the upcoming <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/ltrainclosure.shtml">L-train tunnel closure</a>:

		<blockquote>
			For 15 months starting in April of 2019, all MTA New York City Transit (NYCT) L train service will be suspended across the East River and within Manhattan to repair damage caused by Superstorm Sandy. The L train will still run within Brooklyn, serving all stops. The temporary closure will directly affect 275,000 of the L Train's 400,000 daily riders, and indirectly affect many more throughout the city. All alternative transit services and traffic management policies are temporary for the duration of the L train closure.
		</blockquote>

  and its effects on nearby neighborhoods in New York City.

  <p>To begin, pick a neighborhood (i.e. choose one along the L-train and sign up on Blackboard).  Create a single page summary of your neighborhood that includes:
	<ul>
		<li> Name of the neighborhood (include in the title),
		<li> The zip code(s) of your neighborhood,
		<li> The census tracts encompassing your neighborhood (see <a href="https://geomap.ffiec.gov/FFIECGeocMap/GeocodeMap1.aspx">Census Tract Finder</a>),
		<li> A map of New York City with your neighborhood highlighted,
		<li> An photo or image that captures your neighborhood,
		<li> The demographics of your neighborhood, and
		<li> The distance of your neighborhood to Federal Hall and to Empire State Building.
	</ul>
	These will be posted in the Blackboard honors section site.

	<p><i>Note:  upload a .pdf to the assignment <tt>HC 1.</tt> in the honors section of <a href="http://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>.  Unlike the Python code, it is not automatically graded. </i></p>

  <li > <b>HC 2:  Cost of Commuting
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 14 September</b>  <br>

		<br>
		<p><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling ="no" src="https://project.wnyc.org/transit-time/index.html#40.76700,-73.96361,14,961" width="80%" height="600" ></iframe>

		<p> FiveThirtyEight analyzed the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-will-pay-56-a-month-to-trim-a-minute-off-their-commute/">cost of commuting</a> in terms of the extra New Yorkers were willing to pay to lessen their commute.  <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/subway-commute-time-impact/">StreetEasy</a> did a similar analysis, measuring from given subway stops (and includes a lovely Tableaux map-- scroll down).

		<p> How will the L-train tunnel closure affect housing prices?  To narrow down the analysis, we will focus on the distance to two landmarks:  Empire State Building (as a proxy for midtown) and Federal Hall (for the financial district) and 3 locations.  You may find <a href="https://project.wnyc.org/transit-time/">WNYC Transit Time</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> useful, as well as
		<a href="https://citymapper.com/nyc?lang=en">CityMapper</a>.

    Pick, at random, three <a href="https://streeteasy.com/rentals">rentals</a> in your neighborhood.

		<ul>
			<li> Compute the <b>shortest commute driving</b> to the Empire State Building or Federal Hall for those locations.  Assume that you are arriving at 8:30am on a weekday.
			<li> Compute the <b>shortest commute by public transit</b> to the Empire State Building or Federal Hall for those locations.  Assume that you are arriving at 8:30am on a weekday.
      <li> Compute the <b>shortest commute by public transit, <u>not using the L-train</u>,</b> to the Empire State Building or Federal Hall for those locations.  Assume that you are arriving at 8:30am on a weekday.
		</ul>

		<p> Using the analysis from FiveThirtyEight, predict what the tunnel closure will do to the prices of your three chosen apartments. Justify your answer.

		<p>Submit a .pdf file analyzing the time and cost of commuting of your neighborhood.  You should use complete sentences and justify your answers with data.

      (<a href="http://www.seattlebikeblog.com/">seattlebikeblog.com</a>)


    <p>The MTA predicts that 275,000 daily riders will be directly affected by the L-train tunnel closure.
    How can that be replaced by existing transit options?  Submit a single page (.pdf file) containing the following information:

    <ul>
        <li> What is the capacity of the L-train during the morning commute?  Include your calculation that how many people each train can hold and the number of trains between 6 and 10am.  Some useful links:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R160_(New_York_City_Subway_car)">R160 Subway Car</a> and
        <a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/pdf/tlcur.pdf">L Train Schedule</a>.
        <li> Assuming a bus lane has <a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2016/05/26/the-supply-and-demand-of-street-space/">capacity of 6,000/hour</a>, how many would be needed to replace the L-train during the morning commute?
        <li> Assuming the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYC_Ferry">ferries with the largest capacity (400 passengers)</a>, how many would be needed to replace the L-train during the morning commute?  What frequency would the ferries need to run to match the L-train service?
        <li> If no transit options were available, and everyone drove in a single occupancy car, how many lanes of traffic would be needed to replace the L-train service (assume <a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2016/05/26/the-supply-and-demand-of-street-space/">capacity of 1,440/hour</a>,)?
        <li> If no transit options were available, how many bike lanes would be needed?  Assume each bike lane has
        <a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2016/05/26/the-supply-and-demand-of-street-space/">capacity of 5,200/hour</a>.
    </ul>

		<p>Submit a .pdf file analyzing the density and zoning of your neighborhood.  You should use complete sentences and justify your answers with data from the readings.

	<hr>
  <li > <b>HC 4:  Neighborhood Rankings</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 28 September</b>  <br>

		<p> Working in pairs or triples, design a ranking for most desirable features of a neighborhood.

		<p>There are multiple rankings of New York City Neighborhoods.  For example,
		<ul>
			<li> <a href="https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/search/best-neighborhoods/m/new-york-city-metro-area/">Niche</a>,

			<li> <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/crime-safety-report/ranking">DNA Info's rankings</a>,

			<li> <a href="https://www.streetadvisor.com/search/cities-in-new-york-city-new-york">Street Advisor</a>
		</ul>


		With your group:
		<ul>
			<li> Assess what these rankings have in common and how they differ.
			<li> Which ranking do you favor and why?
			<li> What qualities make a neighborhood desirable place to live?
			<li> Collate a list of the three most important.
		</ul>

		<p>Submit a .pdf file containing your assessment of the rankings and the three most desirable qualities.  You should use complete sentences, compare and contrast the rankings above, and justify the three qualities that your group thought most important.
		</p>

	<li > <b>HC 5:  Walking in NYC Neighborhoods
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 5 October</b>  <br>

		<br>
		<p><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.walkscore.com" width="80%" height="400" ></iframe>


		<p>  Urban planner, Jeff Speck, argues that if a city succeeds at
		being walkable, it excels at having a high quality of life (see his
		<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_speck_the_walkable_city">TED talk</a>).

		<p> Working in pairs or triples, analyze his argument in terms of five neighborhoods in New York City and the ranking you determined in HC 4.  For five of the neighborhoods chosen by class (1-page summaries from HC 1 are available on Blackboard), determine the following:
		<ul>
			<li> Rank the five neighborhoods by your ranking from HC 4.  Explain how you determined the neighborhoods ranked (you can have ties, but you need to justify the rankings, even in the case of ties).
			<li> How did the 5 neighborhoods do in terms of walkability (order the neighborhoods by their <a href= "https://www.walkscore.com">walk scores</a>).

		</ul>

		<p> Does your ranking concur with ranking the neighborhoods by walkability?  Justify your answer.

		<p>Submit a .pdf file analyzing the your rankings and walkability of five neighborhoods chosen for the class.  You should use complete sentences and justify your answers with data.

	<li > <b>HC 6:  Neighborhood geoJSON Map

	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 12 October</b>  <br>

  <p><href="http://geojson.org"><img src="geoJSON.png" height = 200></a>

		<p> Using the geoJSON mapper (see <a href="geoJSONnotes.html">geoJSON notes</a>), make a JSON file that includes the following features:
		<ul>
			<li> Your L-train neighborhood marked as a region (e.g. polygon),
      <li> The L-train (marked as a gray line),
			<li> Other major transportation corridors (e.g. subway lines, major bus routes, or major roads) marked as lines, and
			<li> Transit stops on your subway lines and major bus routes (marked as points).
		</ul>
		<p> Commit to github, and view using the github preview button (you should see you encoding rendered graphically on a map).

		<p> Submit a screenshot of your map as a .pdf file.

	<hr>



	<li > <b>HC 7:  Highlighted Map
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 19 October</b>  <br>


    <p><img src="hunterSatMap.png" height = 300>
    <img src="hiLight.png" height = 300>

		<p>
    For this program, we will create a highlighted map around your station, with the region within about a 1/4 mile box at full brightness, the region that outside that box at 50% brightness.

		<p> To do this:
		<ul>
			<li> Create a .png file of a satellite map, centered on your L-station (Google maps works well for this, but you can use any mapping site to create your base map).
			<li> Write a Python program that reads in an image and saves the image to another file.  Run your program to make sure the reading and saving of an image works.
      <li> Set the upper region of the image to 50% brightness (hint:  uses slices and see example in Lecture 3 and 4).  Run your program to make sure it has dimmed up the upper region and adjust to get the correct dimenssions.
      <li> Set the lower region of the image to 50% brightness (hint:  think about what negative numbers mean as indices).  Run your program and fix any bugs.
			<li> Next, dim the side regions (hint:  think about what parts of the image have not been dimmed and change only those regions.)
		</ul>

		<p> Submit your answer as a .pdf file to gradescope.

      <br>(Entries, exits, and difference via turnstile #1 at 68th Street-Hunter College station for the week ending 1 September 2018)


		<p> In <a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a> (24 October), we introduced
		<a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us">NYC OpenData</a>.

		<p> THe MTA keeps track of the number of people entering and exiting each station via the <a href="http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html">turnstiles</a>.  Readings of how many people entered and exited are measured every 4 hours.
    Some stations measure the numbers at midnight, 4am, 8am, noon, 4pm, and 8pm.  Others are measured on slightly shifted schedules, but always 4 hours apart.  For example, the 68th Street-Hunter College station has each turnstile measured at 1am, 5am, 9am, 1pm, 5pm, and 9pm.  These numbers are recorded as running totals.  For example, here is the data from the 68th Street-Hunter College station for September 22:

<pre>
C/A,UNIT,SCP,STATION,LINENAME,DIVISION,DATE,TIME,DESC,ENTRIES,EXITS
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,01:00:00,REGULAR,0026638604,0015384642
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,05:00:00,REGULAR,0026638606,0015384646
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,09:00:00,REGULAR,0026638640,0015384847
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,13:00:00,REGULAR,0026638946,0015385117
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,17:00:00,REGULAR,0026639543,0015385340
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/22/2018,21:00:00,REGULAR,0026639975,0015385496
R246,R177,00-00-00,68ST-HUNTER CO,6,IRT,09/23/2018,01:00:00,REGULAR,0026640099,0015385542
</pre>

    <p> The last two entries on the lines are the entries and exits for that turnstile (in this case, the numbered <tt>00-00-00</tt>).  At 1am, the entry total was <tt>0026638604</tt> and the exit total was <tt>0015384642</tt>.  Four hours later, the entry total was <tt>0026638606</tt> and the exit total was <tt>0015384646</tt>.  So, over that 4-hour period, <tt>0026638606-0026638604 = 2</tt> people entered the station via that turnstile.  Similarly, 4 people left the station via that turnstile.

    <p>Pick a turnstile in your station and make a plot of the number of entries and a plot of the number of exits for the week ending <a href="http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/turnstile/turnstile_180901.txt">1 September 2018</a>.

    <p>Some useful tips:
    <ul>
       <li> If you have your turnstile data stored in a variable, <tt>turnsData</tt>, you can select the data for a single station (for example, <tt>68TH-HUNTER CO</tt>) with the command:
         <pre>
           turnsData[ turnsData["STATION"] == "68ST-HUNTER CO" ]
         </pre>
        You can similarly select a single turns(for example, <tt>00-00-01</tt>) with <tt>turnsHunter</tt> and the column name <tt>SCP</tt>.
      <li> Some of the data files had extra spaces after "EXITS".  Pandas thinks those spaces are part of the name of your column.  You can either include the spaces (i.e. "EXITS   ") or you can edit the CSV file and remove the trailing spaces and safe the file.
      <li> You can create a column that contains the difference between the entries and exits at each time point with:
        <pre>
          myTurns["Entries - Exits"] = myTurns["ENTRIES"] - myTurns["EXITS"]
        </pre>
    </ul>

		<p> Submit your answer as a .pdf file.  Include in your .pdf:  the 3 plots and the total number of people who entered via your turnstile as well as the total number who exited via your turnstile over the week.

	<hr>

	<li > <b>HC 9:  Webpage</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 2 November</b>  <br>

		<br>
		<img height = 125 src="nyc311.png">

		<p> Make a program that takes a turnstile data file and makes a graph of the entries to the L-train stations on a given data.  The x-axis of your histogram should be the L-train stations, ordered west-to-east.  The bars in the historgram should be the number of people entering the station between 4am and 8am (i.e. subtract the cumulative total at 4am from the cumulative total at 8am).  Further, your program should highlight, in some fashion (e.g. bold in the labels or different color), your group's neighborhoods.

	<li > <b>HC 11: Project Plan</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 16 November</b>  <br>

		<p> The honors section will have final presentations on 12 December, addressing, the  <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/ltrainclosure.shtml">L-train tunnel closure</a>:

  		<blockquote>
  			For 15 months starting in April of 2019, all MTA New York City Transit (NYCT) L train service will be suspended across the East River and within Manhattan to repair damage caused by Superstorm Sandy. The L train will still run within Brooklyn, serving all stops. The temporary closure will directly affect 275,000 of the L Train's 400,000 daily riders, and indirectly affect many more throughout the city. All alternative transit services and traffic management policies are temporary for the duration of the L train closure.
  		</blockquote>

    <p>In particular,
      <blockquote>
  			Focusing on different L-train neighborhoods, how will the residents get to work?
  		</blockquote>

		<p>You may work in teams of up to 3 students to develop your presentation, which has 2 parts:
		<ul>
			<li> A 60-second lightning presentation (upto 2 slides) that contains who is on the team, the neighborhoods you chose (at least one per group member and at least two, whichever is greater), and a brief description of your the effects of the L-train tunnel closure on these neighborhoods, how well will the current MTA plans mitigate the effects, and what additional transit services would be needed, and
			<li> A computer "poster" (aka a github site) consisting of a website with a description of your neighborhoods, an analysis of the effects of the L-train tunnel closure and MTA plans on your neighborhoods and what additional services are needed.
		</ul>

		<p>For this group assignment, include in a .pdf file:
		<ul>
			<li> The neighborhoods that your team has chosen,
			<li> The names of the team members,
			<li> A rough estimate of the effects of the closure on the different neighborhoods and ideas (for example: an estimate of how many riders will be displaced in your neighborhood), and
			<li> A paragraph outlining what services (e.g. additional buses, ferries, bikes, temporary road reconfigurations or restrictions) your neighborhoods would need to mitigate the effects.

    <p><b>Make a Voronoi Diagram...  Change to be the subway cachements with and without the L-train stations.</b>

		<br>
		<p><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling ="no" src="zoning2.html" width="80%" height="600" ></iframe>



		<p> We can use the city data to create a zoning map highlighting features.  The above map shades regions based on a value (these are often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">choropleth maps</a>), with the regions being zoning districts and the coloring based on whether the district is primarily residential, commercial, or manufacturing.

		<p> The map was created with files from the city, augmented by adding an unique ID for each region, so, we could line up the geometric region with the zoning information (see <a href="https://stjohn.github.io/teaching/seminar4/s17/cw8.html">details</a>).  The underlying files are:
		<ul>
			<li> <a href="zoneMap.py">zoneMap.py</a> which creates an HTML map using the data files,
			<li> <a href="zoningIDS.json">zoningIDs.json</a> which contains the geometry/shapes of the zoning districts (with unique IDs added), and
			<li> <a href="zoneDist.csv">zoneDist.csv</a> which has the districts with zoning designation.
		</ul>

		For this group assignment, modify the Python file so that it creates an new zoning map with the following properties:
		<ul>
			<li> commercial and manufacturing (all non-residential zones) are marked as yellow (or, if you hate the current color scheme, the lightest color in your chosen color map).
			<li> all regions that are low density (R1, R2, R3, and their variations in the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/districts-tools/residence-districts-r1-r10.page">NYC zoning</a>) are orange.
			<li> all regions with medium to high density (all other residential zoning designations) are red.
		</ul>

		<p> Modify your program to make a second map where low and medium density housing are orange and only high density (R8, R9, and R10) are red.

		<p> Submit a .pdf file with a screen capture image of your first HTML map (grouping together medium and high density) and your second HTML map (separating out high density) zoning.
