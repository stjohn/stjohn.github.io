<h2><br>
Quiz Information<br>CSci 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2019<br><br>
</h2>
</div>

<div>
At every recitation, there will be an in-class quiz on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and laboratory
exercises.
<ul>
	<li> As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
	as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.
	<li> All quizzes must be taken during class time, and <b>there are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).
	<li> The quizzes are on paper, and you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc.).

	<li> If you miss your assigned recitation, you may take a quiz during another section before the deadline, subject to availability and instructor's permission.
</ul>

Those questions contain additional Unix commands (covered in later labs); this quiz will only have those we have covered thus far:  <tt>ls</tt>, <tt>ls -l</tt>, <tt>pwd</tt>, <tt>cd</tt>, <tt>mkdir</tt>, <tt>cp</tt>, and <tt>mv</tt>.
