<ul>

	<li > <b>HC 1:  Favorite Neighborhood</b>  <b style="float:right">Due Date: 9 February</b>  <br>
	
	<p>  Throughout the semester, we will focus on neighborhoods in New York City.  To start this off, pick a neighborhood (e.g. one you live in, have lived in, like visiting).  Create a single page summary of your neighborhood that includes:
	<ul>
		<li> Name of the neighborhood (include in the title),
		<li> The zip code(s) of your neighborhood,
		<li> The census tracts encompassing your neighborhood (see <a href="https://geomap.ffiec.gov/FFIECGeocMap/GeocodeMap1.aspx">Census Tract Finder</a>), 
		<li> A map of New York City with your neighborhood highlighted, 
		<li> An photo or image that captures your neighborhood, 
		<li> The demographics of your neighborhood, and
		<li> The distance of your neighborhood to Federal Hall and to Empire State Building.
	</ul>
	These will be posted in the Blackboard honors section site.

	<p><i>Note:  upload a .pdf to the assignment <tt>HC 1.</tt> in the honors section of <a href="http://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>.  Unlike the Python code, it is not automatically graded. </i></p>
	
	<li > <b>HC 2:  Neighborhood Rankings:</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 16 February</b>  <br>		
		
		<p> Working in pairs or triples, design a ranking for most desirable features of a neighborhood.
		
		<p>There are multiple rankings of New York City Neighborhoods.  For example, 
		<ul>
			<li> <a href="https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/search/best-neighborhoods/m/new-york-city-metro-area/">Niche</a>,

			<li> <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/crime-safety-report/ranking">DNA Info's rankings</a>, 
			<li> <a href="https://www.brickunderground.com/live/best-nyc-neighborhoods-for-college-grads-2016">Brick Underground</a>,
			<li><a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2017/9/19/16329796/nyc-best-neighborhood-transit-walk-bike-score">Curbed's Walkable Neighborhoods</a>,
			<li> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/where-should-you-actually-live-in-new-york-city?utm_term=.dvk8EJ3Ne#.clDxXrwq4">BuzzFeed</a>,			
			<li> <a href="https://www.streetadvisor.com/search/neighborhoods-in-manhattan-new-york-city-new-york">Street Advisor</a>
		</ul>


		With your group:
		<ul>
			<li> Assess what these rankings have in common and how they differ.  
			<li> Which ranking do you favor and why?
			<li> What qualities make a neighborhood desirable place to live? 
			<li> Collate a list of the three most important.
		</ul>	
			
		<p>Submit a .pdf file containing your assessment of the rankings and the three most desirable qualities.  You should use complete sentences, compare and contrast the rankings above, and justify the three qualities that your group thought most important.
		</p>
		

	<li > <b>HC 3:  Neighborhood Density & Zoning</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 23 February</b>  <br>		
	
		<br><br>
		<p>
		<a href="nycDensity1950.pdf"><img width = 200 src="nycDensity1950.pdf"></a>
		<a href="nycDensity1970.pdf"><img width = 200 src="nycDensity1970.pdf"></a>
		<a href="nycDensity1990.pdf"><img width = 200 src="nycDensity1990.pdf"></a>
		<a href="nycDensity2010.pdf"><img width = 200 src="nycDensity2010.pdf"></a>
		</p>
		
		<p> The final presentations will focus on:
		
		<blockquote>
			Mayor De Blasio wants to <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/682-17/mayor-de-blasio-complete-affordable-housing-plan-2-years-ahead-schedule-accelerate-pace-and#/0">add 300,000 housing units</a> to the city.  Where and how many could go in your neighborhood?  What extra services (e.g. transit and roads, schools, emergency services) would be needed to accommodate the increased population?
		</blockquote>
		
		<p> Over the next couple of weeks, we will introduce Python programming tools to analyse and map the large data sets available from NYC.
		
		<p> Before we do that, we will start by examining characteristics of your neighborhood.  For this assignment, submit a single page (.pdf file) containing the following information:
		<ul>
			<li> The name of your neighborhood (include in title) and a small 
			map of New York City with your neighborhood highlighted (from the first assignment).
			<li> How many people live in your neighborhood?  One way to estimate this number is to use 2010 Census Data for the census tracts you identified in the first assignment and use 
			<a href="http://maps.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/">NYCityMap</a>.
			<li> What is the density of your neighborhood?  Use the census tracts (from first assignment) with the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/nyc-population/historical-population/pop_density_1950_2010.pdf">NYC Population Density</a> to answer the question.
			<li> Has your neighborhood become more or less dense over time?  Include data to support your answer.
			<li> What is the zoning of your neighborhood?  What are the tallest building allowed?  What is the predominant zoning designation?  What does it allow?  Helpful tools for this include the city's 
			<a href="https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/about#15.72/40.7679/-73.9614">zoning map</a> and <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/districts-tools.page">zoning explanations</a>.
		</ul>
		
		<p>Submit a .pdf file analyzing the density and zoning of your neighborhood.  You should use complete sentences and justify your answers with data from the readings.

	<li > <b>HC 4:  Cost of Commuting
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 2 March</b>  <br>	
	
		<br>
		<p><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling ="no" src="https://project.wnyc.org/transit-time/index.html#40.76700,-73.96361,14,961" width="80%" height="600" ></iframe>
	
		<p> FiveThirtyEight analyzed the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-will-pay-56-a-month-to-trim-a-minute-off-their-commute/">cost of commuting</a> in terms of the extra New Yorkers were willing to pay to lessen their commute.  <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/subway-commute-time-impact/">StreetEasy</a> did a similar analysis, measuring from given subway stops (and includes a lovely Tableaux map-- scroll down).
		
		<p> Is this true for your neighborhood?  To narrow down the analysis, we will focus on the distance to two landmarks:  Empire State Building (as a proxy for midtown) and Federal Hall (for the financial district).  You may find <a href="https://project.wnyc.org/transit-time/"https://project.wnyc.org/transit-time/">WNYC Transit Time</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> useful, as well as
		<a href="https://citymapper.com/nyc?lang=en">CityMapper</a>.
		
		<ul>
			<li> In your neighborhood, what is the <b>longest commute driving</b> to the Empire State Building or Federal Hall?  Assume that you are arriving at 8:30am on a weekday.  
			<li> In your neighborhood, what is the <b>longest commute by public transit</b> to the Empire State Building or Federal Hall?  Assume that you are arriving at 8:30am on a weekday.  
			<li> In your neighborhood, what is the <b>shortest commute driving</b> to the Empire State Building or Federal Hall?  Assume that you are arriving at 8:30am on a weekday.  
			<li> In your neighborhood, what is the <b>shortest commute by public transit</b> to the Empire State Building or Federal Hall?  Assume that you are arriving at 8:30am on a weekday.  			
		</ul>
		
		Pick, at random, three <a href="https://streeteasy.com/rentals">rentals</a> near each of these locations (make sure all have similar size-- for example, filter all to be 1-bedroom units).  
		
		<p> Do the prices in your random sample match what FiveThirtyEight found?  Justify your answer.
		
		<p>Submit a .pdf file analyzing the time and cost of commuting of your neighborhood.  You should use complete sentences and justify your answers with data.
		</p>

		

		
	<li > <b>HC 5:  Walking in NYC Neighborhoods 
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 9 March</b>  <br>	
	
		<br>
		<p><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.walkscore.com" width="80%" height="400" ></iframe>
	

		<p>  Urban planner, Jeff Speck, argues that if a city succeeds at 
		being walkable, it excels at having a high quality of life (see his 
		<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_speck_the_walkable_city">TED talk</a>).
	
		<p> Analyze his argument in terms of five neighborhoods in New York City and the ranking you determined in HC 2.  For five of the neighborhoods chosen by class (1-page summaries from HC 1 are available on Blackboard), determine the following:
		<ul>
			<li> Rank the five neighborhoods by your ranking from HC 2.  Explain how you determined the neighborhoods ranked (you can have ties, but you need to justify the rankings, even in the case of ties). 
			<li> How did the 5 neighborhoods do in terms of walkability (order the neighborhoods by their <a href= "https://www.walkscore.com">walk scores</a>).  

		</ul>
		
		<p> Does your ranking concur with ranking the neighborhoods by walkability?  Justify your answer.
		
		<p>Submit a .pdf file analyzing the your rankings and walkability of five neighborhoods chosen for the class.  You should use complete sentences and justify your answers with data.
		</p>	



	<li > <b>HC 6:  Neighborhood geoJSON Map
	
	</b> <b style="float:right">Due Date: 13 March</b>  <br>		

		<p> Using the geoJSON mapper (see <a href="hc5.html">geoJSON notes</a>), make a JSON file that includes the following features:
		<ul>
			<li> your neighborhood marked as a region (e.g. polygon),
			<li> major transportation corridors (e.g. subway lines, major bus routes, or major roads) marked as lines, and
			<li> three landmarks, marked as points (can be 3 points that are important in general or important to you).
		</ul>
		<p> Commit to github, and view using the github preview button (you should see you encoding rendered graphically on a map). 
		
		<p> Submit a screenshot of your map as a .pdf file.

<p><b>Put image of green roofs and temperature</b>


		<p> 
		Studies have shown that increased vegetation and light-colored roofs can significantly decrease temperature in urban environments. 
		In <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>, we counted the snow pack in California.  Use those techniques to read in an image file and create a new image where all points that are close to white (i.e. have a threshold of > .75 for red, green, and blue values) are colored red in the resulting image.  
 
		<p> Submit as a program-- your program should allow the user to set the input 
		<p> Using the image above, create a new image that shows only regions that are significantly cooler than the average (defined as regions whose temperature is a standard deviation below the mean of temperatures mapped).
		
		
		Use the techniques developed in <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> and <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>,  
		
		
		numpy-- using the built-in flatten both images-- what channel has the change?, make a scatter plot of roof color and...
		


Scatter plot the colors of veg vs. temp (amount of green vs. amount of blue).  
Compute correlation and regression line.  Need to happen after 12 March.
