	<p> <b>Favorite Neighborhood:</b> Throughout the semester, we will focus on neighborhoods in New York City.  To start this off, pick a neighborhood (e.g. one you live in, have lived in, like visiting).  Create a single page summary of your neighborhood that includes:
	<ul>
		<li> Name of the neighborhood (include in the title),
		<li> The zip code(s) of your neighborhood,
		<li> The census tracts encompassing your neighborhood (see <a href="https://geomap.ffiec.gov/FFIECGeocMap/GeocodeMap1.aspx">Census Tract Finder</a>), 
		<li> A map of New York City with your neighborhood highlighted, 
		<li> An photo or image that captures your neighborhood, 
		<li> The demographics of your neighborhood, and
		<li> The distance of your neighborhood to Federal Hall and to Empire State Building.
	</ul>
	These will be posted in the Blackboard honors section site.

	<p><i>Note:  upload a .pdf to the assignment <tt>HC 1.</tt> in the honors section of <a href="http://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>.  Unlike the Python code, it is not automatically graded. </i>
	
	<li > <b>HC 2</b>. <b style="float:right">Due Date: 16 February</b>  <br>		
		
		<p><b>Neighborhood Rankings:</b> Working in pairs or triples, design a ranking for most desirable features of a neighborhood.
		
		<p>There are multiple rankings of New York City Neighborhoods.  For example, 
		<ul>
			<li> <a href="https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/search/best-neighborhoods/m/new-york-city-metro-area/">Niche</a>,

			<li> <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/crime-safety-report/ranking">DNA Info's rankings</a>, 
			<li> <a href="https://www.brickunderground.com/live/best-nyc-neighborhoods-for-college-grads-2016">Brick Underground</a>,
			<li><a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2017/9/19/16329796/nyc-best-neighborhood-transit-walk-bike-score">Curbed's Walkable Neighborhoods</a>,
			<li> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/where-should-you-actually-live-in-new-york-city?utm_term=.dvk8EJ3Ne#.clDxXrwq4">BuzzFeed</a>,			
			<li> <a href="https://www.streetadvisor.com/search/neighborhoods-in-manhattan-new-york-city-new-york">Street Advisor</a>
		</ul>


		With your group:
		<ul>
			<li> Assess what these rankings have in common and how they differ.  
			<li> Which ranking do you favor and why?
			<li> What qualities make a neighborhood desirable place to live? 
			<li> Collate a list of the three most important.
		</ul>	
			
		Submit a .pdf file containing your assessment of the rankings and the three most desirable qualities.  You should use complete sentences, compare and contrast the rankings above, and justify the three qualities that your group thought most important.
