<h3>GIS Data</h3>

<p> We will be mapping and analyzing GIS data as the course progresses.  There are several standard formats for mapping GIS data:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">Shapefiles</a> (<a href="http://www.esri.com/arcgis/about-arcgis">ERSI's ArcGIS</a>)
	<li> <a href="https://developers.google.com/kml/">Keynote Markup Languange</a> (KML)
	<li><a href="http://geojson.org">geoJSON</a>
</ul>
Here's an <a href="http://apprentice.craic.com/tutorials/28">excellent summary & comparison</a> of these formats.

<p> Note:  In <a href="lab9.html">Lab 9</a>, we will introduce the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/folium">Folium</a> Python package that creates HTML maps.  For the honors section, we will use additional features in <tt>folium</tt> for creating choropleth maps using geoJSON files.

</div>


<div>
<h3>github</h3>

<p>
We introduce <a href="https://github.com">github</a>, the standard way to share and collaborate on code, in <a href="lab8.html">Lab 8</a>.  It also has a nice feature for quickly previewing <tt>geoJSON</tt> files.   

If you do not already have a <tt>github</tt> account, follow the directions in <a href="lab8.html">Lab 8</a> to set one up to use below (you can also submit the corresponding programming assignment on it early).

<h3>geoJSON</h3>

<p>
We will be primarily using <tt>geoJSON</tt> files for this course.
Use the <a href="http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0">geojson's mapper</a>, locate your favorite neighborhood.  Mark a favorite location in the neighborhood (or a landmark) as a <tt>point</tt> (select from the menu on the right of the map).  
<ul>
	<li>On the right hand side, the corresponding <tt>geoJSON</tt> file will be created.  
	<li> Save the file and upload to <tt>github</tt> (see above).
	<li> Commit the file and preview.  <br>
	You should see the a map pop up in the preview window.
	<br>
	(Here's a <a href="
	https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/">helpful example</a>.)
</ul>

<p>Here's a nice description of <a href="http://www.macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html">basic concepts of geoJSON</a>:
<ul>
	<li> Read/skim the description of different types. 
	<li> What types are in the geoJSON file you created above?
	<li> Using the mapper, add a polygon outlining your neighborhood.  What was created in the corresponding geoJSON file?
	<li> Create two additional markers for favorite places or landmarks in your neighborhood.  
	<li> Also in your file, mark the major transit lines (subway, train, or bus). 
</ul>

<h3>geoJSON and folium</h3>

Folium provides a simple interface to leaflet.js for mapping geoJSON data.
Work through example from tutorial that uses a geoJSON layer for
<a href="https://libraries.io/pypi/folium">folium</a>.


<p>
<i>These have moved since this classwork was written, a similar version is
at <a href=""></a>.  Note that the rewrite of the examples assumes that you are using jupyter and displays in-line.  To save an .html file to diplay, you need to save it (<tt>mapName.save(outfile='htmlFile.html')</tt>)</i>

<p>
Using your the geoJSON file that you created.  What do the different 
tile options do?  That is, how do the following options change your
map:

<ul>
	<li> <tt>tiles='Stamen Terrain'</tt>
	<li> <tt>tiles='stamenwatercolor'</tt>
	<li> <tt>tiles='Mapbox Bright'</tt>
	<li> <tt>tiles='Stamen Toner'</tt>
	<li> <tt>tiles='Cartodb Positron'</tt>
</ul>

<div>
<h3>Additional Challenges</h3>

Through the <a href="http://opendata.cityofnewyork.us">open data project</a>, there are many geoJSON layers available.  Download some of the following and use folium to create different webpages displaying these <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page">political and administrative districts</a>:
<ul>
	<li> NYC Boroughs
	<li> NYC zip codes
	<li> NY Congressional Districts
</ul>
For each, choose an appropriate background map. Note that you can combine these with your own datasets (i.e. overlap your 311 complaints on top of zip codes or congressional districts).
