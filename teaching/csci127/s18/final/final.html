  <img height=400 src="examMapFinal.png">
  <li> When you enter the classroom, you will sign in with the proctor.  Each proctor has the sign-in list of the students assigned to their region:  A-Chak, Chan-Joh, Jos-Mec, Mig-Tsv, and Tyl-Z.  
  <li> After everyone is seated, the proctors will distribute the exams and check IDs.
  <li> To get credit for the exam, you will need to also sign out as you turn in your exam.
  <li> To minimize confusion, you will need to wait until all exams have been passed out and IDs checked before you can submit your exam.   
</ul>

<h3>How to Prepare</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure you do all the problems that have been
assigned. The problems (or parts of them) make excellent exam
questions. </li>
  <li> Work through the past exams. These (or variations of them)
often appear on exams. </li>
  <li> While you can photocopy your one page of notes, preparing it by hand is
  an excellent way to study.  First, go through each problem and notes from each lecture, and make a list of the important concepts and ideas in each.  Then, consolidate your list to fit on a single sheet of paper.  Include standard formats or templates for coding constructs and design patterns, as well as samples of recurring themes. 
</ul>
