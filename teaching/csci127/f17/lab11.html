<p>
Today's lab will introduce a simplified machine language.

<p>Software tools needed:  web browser and a graphical editor, such as <tt>gEdit</tt>.

<h3>Simplified Machine Language</h3>

<p> In today's lab, we will explore a programming language that is very "low level" in that it maps very closely to the actual commands that are used by the computer's processor.

<p> We will use a simulator, <a href="">weMIPS</a>, to emulate what a machine-level language would do for a popular class of computer processors, MIPS.  Processors with <a href="">MIPS</a> are a Reduced Instructor Set Computer (RISC), meaning they have fewer different types of instructions that the processor knows (and thus fewer that have to be implemented, leading to faster processors).

<h3>Command Line:  Using Pipes</h3>

</div>

<div>
<h3>More on Unix:  Using Pipes</h3>

<p> Unix has a very useful construct to let you glue together commands to perform more complex actions.

<p> Simple pipe example with ls and grepping all the .py files in the directory.

<p> Let's put this into a script.  Remember to use <tt>Unix</tt> end-of-lines, since gradescope will run what you submit as a Unix script and will be very confused if you have non-Unix (i.e. Windows-style) end-of-lines.

<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a <a href="quizzes.html">quiz</a>.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.  To complete the quiz, log on to Blackboard (see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on using Blackboard).

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you, and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
