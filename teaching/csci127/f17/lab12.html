<h2>Lab 12<br>CSci 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2017<br><br>
</h2>
</div>

<div>

<p>
Today's lab will introduce C++.  

<p>Software tools needed:  web browser and the C++ compiler, <tt>gcc</tt> and a graphical editor, such as <tt>gEdit</tt>.



</div>



<div>
<h3>Using <tt>gcc</tt></h3>

<p>Compiling programs, link to gcc, give full example with g++ hello.cc to create a.out, run a.out from command line.

</div>

<div>
<h3>Hello World</h3>

<p>Use gEdit to create a file that says hello world:

<pre>
hello program
</pre>

Go through the steps above, repeat here for hello.py

<p>When it compiles, and runs correctly (i.e. printing Hello World to the screen), see the <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a>.

<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a <a href="quizzes.html">quiz</a>.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.  To complete the quiz, log on to Blackboard (see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on using Blackboard).

</div>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you, and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
