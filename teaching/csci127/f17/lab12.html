<h2>Lab 12<br>CSci 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2017<br><br>
</h2>
</div>

<div>

<p>
Today's lab will introduce C++.  

<p>Software tools needed:  web browser and the C++ compiler, <tt>gcc</tt> and a graphical editor, such as <tt>gEdit</tt>.



</div>



<div>
<h3>Using <tt>gcc</tt></h3>

<p>Compiling programs, link to gcc, give full example with g++ hello.cc to create a.out, run a.out from command line.

<p>From Subash:
To avoid cluttering your home directory, create a directory titled lab1. The instructor's home directory contains a small program whose name starts with "." and ends with "1a.cpp". If you don't know how to find the file, use man to find the proper ls option (and/or use wildcards). Find this file, copy it to ~/lab1/lab1a.cpp, compile (using g++ -o lab1a lab1a.cpp), and run it (./lab1a). What does it output? 
One problem with the program is that it does not output a carriage return (so, the prompt for the next command is on the same line). Edit the program to add your instructor's name at the end of the output, and also fix the above problem. Rerun. 


</div>

<div>
<h3>Hello World</h3>

<p>Use gEdit to create a file that says hello world:

<pre style = "background-color:lavender;width:450px">
hello program
</pre>

Go through the steps above, repeat here for hello.cpp

<p>When it compiles, and runs correctly (i.e. printing Hello World to the screen), see the <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a>.

<div>
<h3>Variables in C++</h3>

Unlike Python, you must declare variables before using them.
</div>


<div>
<h3>Definite Loops in C++</h3>

Outline how to write for-loops.
</div>

<div>
<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a <a href="quizzes.html">quiz</a>.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.  To complete the quiz, log on to Blackboard (see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on using Blackboard).

</div>



<div>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you, and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
