For this example, the two sequences to be globally aligned are</p><p> G A A T T C A G T T A   (sequence #1)<br>G G A T C G A           (sequence #2)</p><p> So M = 11 and N = 7 (the length of sequence #1 and sequence #2, respectively)</p><p>An advanced scoring scheme is assumed where</p><ul><li> S<sub>i,j</sub> = 2  if the residue at position i of sequence #1                         is the same as the residue at position j of sequence#2                         (match score); otherwise </li><li> S<sub>i,j</sub> = -1 (mismatch score)</li><li> w = -2 (gap penalty)</li></ul><h2><center>Initialization Step</center></h2><p>The first step in the global alignment dynamic programming approach is tocreate a matrix with M + 1 columns and N + 1 rows where M and N correspond tothe size of the sequences to be aligned.</p><p> The first row and first column of the matrix can be initially filled with 0.</p><p></p><center><img src="adv_dynamic_files/initial.gif"></center><h2><center>Matrix Fill Step</center></h2><p>One possible (inefficient) solution of the matrix fill step finds themaximum global alignment score by starting in the upper left hand corner inthe matrix and finding the maximal score M<sub>i,j</sub> for each position in thematrix.  In order to find M<sub>i,j</sub> for any i,j it is minimal to know thescore for the matrix positions to the left, above and diagonal to i, j.  Interms of matrix positions, it is necessary to know M<sub>i-1,j</sub>,M<sub>i,j-1</sub> and M<sub>i-1, j-1</sub>.</p><p>For each position, M<sub>i,j</sub> is defined to be the maximum score   at position i,j; i.e. </p><p></p><pre><b>M<sub>i,j</sub> = MAXIMUM[     M<sub>i-1, j-1</sub> + S<sub>i,j</sub></b> (match/mismatch in the diagonal),     <b>M<sub>i,j-1</sub> + w </b>(gap in sequence #1),     <b>M<sub>i-1,j</sub> + w </b>(gap in sequence #2)<b>]</b></pre><p> Note that in the example, M<sub>i-1,j-1</sub> will be red,    M<sub>i,j-1</sub> will be green and M<sub>i-1,j</sub> will be blue.</p><p> Using this information, the score at position 1,1 in the matrix can be    calculated.  Since the first residue in both sequences is a G, S<sub>1,1    </sub> = 2, and by the assumptions stated earlier, w = -2.  Thus,     M<sub>1,1</sub> = MAX[M<sub>0,0</sub> + 2, M<sub>1,0</sub> - 2, M<sub>0,1    </sub> - 2] = MAX[2, -2, -2].</p><p>A value of 2 is then placed in position 1,1 of the scoring matrix.   Note that there is also an arrow placed back into the cell that resulted   in the maximum score, M[0,0].</p><p></p><center><img src="adv_dynamic_files/advanced_1.gif"></center><hr><p> Moving down the first column to row 2, we can see that there is once again    a match in both sequences. Thus, S<sub>1,2</sub> = 2. So M<sub>1,2</sub> =    MAX[M<sub>0,1</sub> + 2, M<sub>1,1</sub> - 2, M<sub>0,2</sub> -2] =     MAX[0 + 2, 2 - 2, 0 - 2] = MAX[2, 0, -2].</p><p> A value of 2 is then placed in position 1,2 of the scoring matrix and an    arrow is placed to point back to M[0,1] which led to the maximum score. </p><p></p><center><img src="adv_dynamic_files/advanced_2.gif"></center><hr><p> Looking at column 1 row 3, there is not a match in the sequences, so S<sub>    1,3</sub> = -1.  M<sub>1,3</sub> = MAX[M<sub>0,2</sub> - 1, M<sub>1,2</sub>    - 2, M<sub>0,3</sub> - 2] = MAX[0 - 1, 2 - 2, 0 - 2] = MAX[-1, 0, -2].</p><p> A value of 0 is then placed in position 1,3 of the scoring matrix and an    arrow is placed to point back to M[1,2] which led to the maximum score.</p><p></p><center><img src="adv_dynamic_files/advanced_3.gif"></center><hr><p> We can continue filling in the cells of the scoring matrix using the same    reasoning.</p><p> Eventually, we get to column 3 row 2.  Since there is not a match in the     sequences at this positon, S<sub>3,2</sub> = -1.  M<sub>3,2</sub> = MAX[    M<sub>2,1</sub> - 1, M<sub>3,1</sub> - 2, M<sub>2,2</sub> - 2] =    MAX[0 - 1, -1 - 2, 1 -2] = MAX[-1, -3, -1].</p><p></p><center><img src="adv_dynamic_files/advanced_8.gif"></center><hr><p> Note that in the above case, there are two different ways to get the     maximum score.  In such a case, pointers are placed back to all of the cells    that can produce the maximum score.</p><p></p><center><img src="adv_dynamic_files/advanced_9.gif"></center><hr><p> The rest of the score matrix can then be filled in.  The completed score     matrix will be as follows:</p><p></p><center><img src="adv_dynamic_files/advanced_10.gif"></center><hr><h2><center>Traceback Step</center></h2>    After the matrix fill step, the maximum global alignment score for the two    sequences is 3.  The traceback step will determine the actual alignment(s)    that result in the maximum score. <p> The traceback step begins in the M,J position in the matrix, i.e. the position     where both sequences are globally aligned. </p><hr><p> Since we have kept pointers back to all possible predacessors, the traceback    step is simple.  At each cell, we look to see where we move next according to    the pointers.  To begin, the only possible predacessor is the diagonal match.</p><p></p><center><img src="adv_dynamic_files/advanced_11.gif"></center><p> This gives us an alignment of </p><pre>    A    |     A</pre><p> Note that the blue letters and gold arrows indicate the path leading to the    maximum score.</p><hr><p> We can continue to follow the path using a single pointer until we get to the    following situation.</p><p></p><center><img src="adv_dynamic_files/advanced_12.gif"></center><p> The alignment at this point is</p><pre>    T C A G T T A    | |   |     |     T C _ G _ _ A</pre><p> Note that there are now two possible neighbors that could result in the     current score.  In such a case, one of the neighbors is arbitrarily     chosen.</p><hr><p> Once the traceback is completed, it can be seen that there are only two    possible paths leading to a maximal global alignment.  </p><hr><p> One possible path is as follows:</p><p></p><center><img src="adv_dynamic_files/advanced_13.gif"></center><p> This gives an alignment of </p><pre>   G A A T T C A G T T A   |   |   | |   |     |    G G A _ T C _ G _ _ A</pre><hr><p> The other possible path is as follows:</p><p></p><center><img src="adv_dynamic_files/advanced_14.gif"></center><p>This gives an alignment of </p><pre>   G A A T T C A G T T A   |   | |   |   |     |   G G A T _ C _ G _ _ A</pre><hr><p> Remembering that the scoring scheme is +2 for a match, -1 for a mismatch,    and -2 for a gap, both sequences can be tested to make sure that they    result in a score of 3.</p><pre>   G A A T T C A G T T A   |   |   | |   |     |    G G A _ T C _ G _ _ A    + - + - + + - + - - +   2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</pre><p> 2 - 1 + 2 - 2 + 2 + 2 - 2 + 2 - 2 - 2 + 2 = 3</p><pre>   G A A T T C A G T T A   |   | |   |   |     |   G G A T _ C _ G _ _ A   + - + + - + - + - - +   2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</pre><p> 2 - 1 + 2 + 2 - 2 + 2 - 2 + 2 - 2 - 2 + 2 = 3</p><p> so both of these alignments do indeed result in the maximal alignment score.</p><hr><a href="http://www.cec.wustl.edu/%7Eecr1/">Eric C.
