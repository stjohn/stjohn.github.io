  From anu:  The course introduces students to some fundamentals of research methodology, and gives students first hand experience by having them carry out a small research project, under close supervision by a member of academic staff. The course comprises a series of lectures which cover the following topics: how to define a research problem; writing a research paper and report; how to give a seminar; the use of search tools and databases to find relevant literature; scientific methods in practice; design of an experiment. Students complete a research project which requires them to carry out background reading and literature review, and to prepare a research report and give a seminar at the end of the course.

  Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:
Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to:
Effectively communicate research questions, methods and outcomes in oral, written and graphical forms to a broad audience using appropriate tools.
Develop and apply an active approach to learning and undertake reflective professional practice.
Justify and apply appropriate technological choices based on a consideration of the research question and methods.
Undertake and manage a research project of significant size and scope and understand the role of collaboration in large research projects.
Explain the process of identifying and formulating research questions.
Apply effective literature search and critical evaluation skills.
Design and conduct experiments, devise appropriate metrics, analyse and interpret data and form reliable conclusions.
Document all aspects of the development and delivery of a significant research project.
Explain the role academic integrity and the importance of building upon and correctly attributing the work of others.

This course is an undergraduate research seminar designed to study research methods in computer science and to support students in the implementation of an independent student project. Student projects can be a software development project, a survey project or a research project.  With the help of faculty, students choose an appropriate project/thesis to study. Computer science research methods are introduced and the various forms of technical writing common to computer science are studied. Students conduct their research/implement their project, write a technical paper as a result, and present their findings during the year-end senior technical conference.  Students also read and critically review several computer science journal articles. This course serves to give students some motivation for pursuing graduate studies.

Course Text: Writing for Computer Science, Third Edition, Justin Zobel. The pdf of this book will be made available for the class.

Course Goals
Goal 1: Students will learn to analyze and interpret unfamiliar computer science technical topics.
Goal 2: Students will learn to use common computer science research and reporting techniques.
Goal 3: Students will practice their written and oral communication skills.
Goal 4: Students will apply skills and knowledge from earlier CS courses to the development of an independent, in-depth project.

Student Learning Objectives

Students should be able to:
Critically read and analyze computer science journal articles for which they have suitable background knowledge. [in support of Goals 1,2]
Research, write up, and present findings relative to a defined technical thesis topic in computer science. [in support of Goals 1,2,3,4]
Assess technical reports and supply written feedback appropriate to a typical conference paper review. [in support of Goals 1,2,3,4]
Give a half hour oral presentation that is appropriate to a typical professional conference. [in support of Goal 3]
Write a 10–15-page technical report/journal article that is appropriate to a typical computer science conference article. [in support of Goal 3]
Integrate and utilize some of the skills and knowledge that they have gained over the course of their undergraduate career. [in support of Goal 1,4]
Orally explain a difficult technical issue in clear and precise terms that are appropriate to their current audience. [in support of Goal 1,3,4]
Pursue the development of a project independently – including knowing where to go to find supportive information and carrying out any background research that is needed. [in support of Goal 4]

This seminar will prepare students to engage in undergraduate research in computer science by introducing and exploring the cycle involved in academic research. Students will learn how to access, read and evaluate credible literature, develop a research problem and hypothesis, select an appropriate methodology, and how to write a short research proposal. Students will engage with departmental research faculty through research talks and will explore and apply for research programs that are available (e.g. URGO, McNair, DREU.) Students will know what research entails, how it is performed, and why it can enhance an undergraduate experience.


<li> Review of trees, build code based on research papers, contribute to code, present papers, present and document code, work collaborately.

<li> The class meets once a week (Wednesdays mornings).  The meetings will primarily be in-person, but some hybrid meetings will be scheduled when outside speakers are remote.

<li> 2.5 hours each week:

<li> Need a computer capable of running Python locally to bring to class.  College has laptops for loan.

<li> Each meeting follows a similar format...  divide into half-- half is algorithm/design based; half is implementation
