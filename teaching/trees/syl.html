<p>
<b>Description:</b>  <i>3 hours, 3 credits:</i>
Hands-on honors algorithms seminar with coding, design, group work, and presentations.
Students will learn how to access, read and evaluate credible literature, develop a research problem and hypothesis, select an appropriate methodology, and how to write a short research proposal.
Topics focus on algorithms for analyzing, comparing, and visualizing trees.
This course is an undergraduate research seminar designed to study research methods in computer science and to support students in the implementation of an independent student project.
<br><b>Prerequisites: </b> CSci 265 and CSci 335.
<br><b>Instructor:</b> <a href="https://stjohn.github.io">Dr. Katherine St. John</a>.
<br><b>Meetings:</b> Wednesdays, 10am-12:30pm, 1001E Hunter North, in-person.
<br><b>Course Email:</b> trees@hunter.cuny.edu.
<br><b>Office Hours:</b> <a href="https://stjohn.github.io/teaching/officeHours.html">Office Hours</a>.


<h2>Grading Policy</h2>

<p><b>Course Format:</b>   This seminar will be run as a research methods course, meeting once a week (Wednesday mornings) in an <b>in-person</b> format.  While primarily be in-person, some hybrid meetings will be scheduled when outside speakers are remote.
Each class meeting will be include collaborative challenges that recap trees, graphs and algorithms, as well as introduce new material.  The focus will be on building competency in algorithmic design and implementation, understanding and presenting tree-focused research papers, and implementing related algorithms with well designed and well documented code.

<!--
<li> Each meeting follows a similar format...  divide into half-- half is algorithm/design based; half is implementation
    <ul>
      <li> Intro--
      <li> Overview-- introduce day's topics
      <li> Teamwork-- challenge working in groups (mixed every day)
      <li>
      <li> Code Challenge--
      <li> Recap & Planning--
    </ul>
</ul>
-->

<p><b>Expectations:</b>
Participating in class and completing programming challenges are an essential part of the learning experience.
Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the textbook and other assigned reading.  Each student is expected to complete and present at least two projects (either individually or as part of a team) over the course of the course.
<!--Students should review topics from
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.-->

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own (or of your group, if submitting group work).
As a general rule, do your own typing. Submitting work of others, or not safeguarding your work from copying, are academic integrity violations.
You
are responsible for knowing and following Hunter College's
<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/student-conduct/academic-integrity/welcome-academic-integrity/?searchterm=integrity">Academic Integrity Policy</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>
Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.</i>
</blockquote>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students office.


<p><b>Participation:</b> Participation is measured by your involvement in lecture as well as the collected classwork.  </p>


<p><b>Programming Assignments:</b>  Assignments are posted on the class
website, usually two weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture and serve as building blocks for the classwork and the semester-long projects.
  <ul>
      <li> To receive full credit for a program, the program must perform correctly, must include comments, be written in good style, and be submitted via <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>.

      <li> While you may consult and discuss with others, this is an individual assignment, and all code must be written and typed by you.  All programs are run through <a href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/3vr6x46ppn-instructor-assignment-programming-code-similarity">similarity review</a> and copied code is reported to the Office of Student Conduct.
      <!-- <li> <b>No late homework is accepted.</b>  Instead, the top 10 weekly programming assignments are counted towards the final programming grade.-->
  </ul>

<p><b>Projects:</b>  Two semester-long projects are part of the course. The grade for the project is a combination of grades earned on the milestones (e.g. deadlines during the semester to keep the projects on track) and the overall submitted program.

<p><b>Quizzes and Exams:</b>  There are no quizzes or exams.  Instead, assessment of mastery of the material will be via programming assignments, participation in class, and presentations of your progress on your projects over the course of the semester.

<p><b>Grades:</b>
  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Participation: 30%.	</li>
      <li>Programming Assignments: 20%. </li>
      <li>Projects: 50%. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
