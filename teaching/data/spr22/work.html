Unless otherwise noted, quizzes focus on the corresponding programming assignment.  They are 30 minutes long and cannot be repeated.  They are available for the 24 hours after lecture and assess your programming skill using HackerRank. Access information for each quiz will be available under the Quizzes menu on  Blackboard.


<!--
  This quiz covers data representation from Lecture #5 and <a href=

<h2>Homework</h2>
</a>

Unless otherwise noted, programs are submitted on the course's Gradescope site and are written in Python.
Also, to receive full credit, the code should be compatible with Python 3.6 (the default for the Gradescope autograders).

<p>All students registered by Monday, 26 January are sent a registration invitation to the email on record on their Blackboard account.  If you did not receive the email or would like to use a different account, post to <code class="inline">Help::Individual Questions</code> (on the left hand menu when logged into the course site on Blackboard).  Include in your post that you not receive a Gradescope invitation, your preferred email, and we will manually generate an invitation.  As a default, we use your name as it appears in Blackboard/CUNYFirst (to update CUNYFirst, see <a href="https://hunter.</i>cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/changing-your-personal-information/">changing your personal information</a>).  If you prefer a different name for Gradescope, include it in your post, and we will update the Gradescope registration.



<p>
To get full credit for a program, the file must include in the opening comment:
<ul>
    <li> Your name, as it appears in your Gradescope registration.
    <li> The email you are using for Gradescope.
    <li> A list of any resources you used for the program.  Include classmates and tutors that you worked with, along with any websites or tutorials that you used.  If you used no resources (other than the class notes and textbooks), then you should include the line:  "No resources used."
</ul>

For example, for the student, Thomas Hunter, the opening comment of his first program might be:
<pre><code class="blockcode">
"""
Name:  Thomas Hunter
Email: thomas.hunter.</i>1870@hunter.</i>cuny.edu
Resources:  Used python.org as a reminder of Python 3 print statements.
"""
</pre></code>
and then followed by his Python program.

<p></p><p><a name="p1"><b>Program 1: Popular Names.</b></b> &emsp; <i>Due noon, Thursday, 10 February.
  <br>Learning Objective: to build competency with string and file I/O functionality of core Python.
  <br>Available Libraries:  Core Python 3.6+ only.</i>

  <p>
  In lecture and the textbook, we looked at how popular names were over time. Write a program that will read from a text file a list of names and return the 3 most popular names and the fraction that those occur in the text file.  To allow for unit testing, your program should have the following functions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <code class = "inline">extract_names(file_name, sep = ["\n"])</code>:
    <li> <code class = "inline">count_names(names_lst)</code>:
      Returns a dictionary of names and the number of times it occurs in the input, <code class="inline">names_lst</code>.
    <li> <code class = "inline">popular_names(names_dict,num = 3)</code>:
      Returns a list of the <code class="inline">num</code> most popular names as a list of strings.  If no value is passed for <code class="inline">num</code>, the default value of 3 is used (that is, it returns the 3 most popular names).
    <li> <code class = "inline">percent_captured(names_dict,threshold = 75)</code>:
      Returns the number of names needed to have at least <code class="inline">threshold</code> percent of all the names in the dictionary.  If no value is passed for <code class="inline">percent</code>, the default value of 75 is used (that is, it returns the number of names needed to have 75 percent (or more) of the total number of names).
  </ul>

  <p>For example, ...  give an example with multiple separators for the file and different thresholds

  <p>Notes:  you should submit a file with only the standard comments at the top, and these functions.  The grading scripts will then import the file for testing.  If your file includes code outside of these functions, either comment the code out before submitting or use a main function that is conditionally executed (see <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//thinkcspy/Functions/mainfunction.html">Think CS: Section 6.8</a> for details).
</p>

A final project is optional for this course. The grade for the project is a combination of grades earned on the milestones (e.g. deadlines during the semester to keep the projects on track) and the overall submitted program. If you choose not to complete the project, your final exam grade will replace its portion of the overall grade.
