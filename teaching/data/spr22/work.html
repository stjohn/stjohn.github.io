<h2>Homework</h2>
</a>

Unless otherwise noted, programs are submitted on the course's Gradescope site and are written in Python.  The autograders expect a <code class="inline">.py</code> file and do not accept iPython notebooks.
Also, to receive full credit, the code should be compatible with Python 3.6 (the default for the Gradescope autograders).

<p>All students registered by Monday, 26 January are sent a registration invitation to the email on record on their Blackboard account.  If you did not receive the email or would like to use a different account, write to <code class="inline">datasci@hunter.cuny.edu</code>.  Include in your email that you not receive a Gradescope invitation, your preferred email, and we will manually generate an invitation.  As a default, we use your name as it appears in Blackboard/CUNYFirst (to update CUNYFirst, see <a href="https://hunter.</i>cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/changing-your-personal-information/">changing your personal information</a>).  If you prefer a different name for Gradescope, include it, and we will update the Gradescope registration.

<p>To encourage starting early on programs, bonus points are given for early submission.  A point a day, up to a total of 3 bonus points (10% of the program grade), are possible.  The points are prorated by hour.  For example, if you turn in the program 36 hours early, then the bonus poins are: (36 hours/3 days)*3 points = (36 hours/72 hours)*3 points = 1.5 points.

<p>
To get full credit for a program, the file must include in the opening comment:
<ul>
    <li> Your name, as it appears in your Gradescope registration.
    <li> The email you are using for Gradescope.
    <li> A list of any resources you used for the program.  Include classmates and tutors that you worked with, along with any websites or tutorials that you used.  If you used no resources (other than the class notes and textbooks), then you should include the line:  "No resources used."
</ul>

For example, for the student, Thomas Hunter, the opening comment of his first program might be:
<pre><code class="blockcode">
"""
Name:  Thomas Hunter
Email: thomas.hunter.</i>1870@hunter.</i>cuny.edu
Resources:  Used python.org as a reminder of Python 3 print statements.
"""
</pre></code>
and then followed by his Python program.

<p></p><p><a name="p1"><b>Program 1: Popular Names.</b></b> &emsp; <i>Due noon, Thursday, 10 February.
  <br>Learning Objective: to build competency with string and file I/O functionality of core Python.
  <br>Available Libraries:  Core Python 3.6+ only.</i>

  <p>
  In lecture and <a href="">Chapter 1</a> of the textbook, we looked at first names for students taking data science at UC Berkeley as well as the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/index.html">baby names data set</a> from the Social Security Administration.  We explored properties such as the lengths of names:

  <p><img src="namesNumChars.png" height=300>

  <p>For this program, we will focus on the most common names in a given file, as well the names that make up a fixed fraction of the names. To allow for unit testing, the assignment is broken into the following functions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <code class = "inline">extract_names(file_name, sep = ["\n"])</code>:  Returns a list of names.  Assumes that the names are separated by the separators listed in <code class = "inline">sep</code>.  The default value is <code class = "inline">["\n"]</code> but the possible inputs are 1 or more separators.  Your function should remove any empty strings from the list.
    <li> <code class = "inline">count_names(names_lst)</code>:
      Returns a dictionary of names with values the number of times each name occurs in the input, <code class = "inline">names_lst</code>.
    <li> <code class = "inline">popular_names(names_dict,num = 3)</code>:
      Returns a list of the <code class="inline">num</code> most popular names as a list of strings.  If no value is passed for <code class="inline">num</code>, the default value of 3 is used (that is, it returns the 3 most popular names).
    <li> <code class = "inline">percent_captured(names_dict,threshold = 75)</code>:
      Returns the number of names needed to have at least <code class="inline">threshold</code> percent of all the names in the dictionary.  If no value is passed for <code class="inline">percent</code>, the default value of 75 is used (that is, it returns the number of names needed to have 75 percent (or more) of the total occurrances of names).
  </ul>

  <p>For example, assuming these functions are in a file, <code class="inline">p1.py</code> and run on a file containing names that start with 'A', <a href="a_names.txt">a_names.txt</a>:

<pre><code class="blockcode">lst = p1.extract_names('a_names.txt')
print(f'The list is:\n{lst}')
dict = p1.count_names(lst)
print(f'The dictionary is:\n{dict}')
lstTop = p1.popular_names(dict)
print(f'The top 3 names are: {lstTop}.')
num = p1.percent_captured(dict, threshold = 50)
print(f'The top {num} names make up 50% of the list.')
</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">The list is:
['Alex', 'Andy', 'Amy', 'Alani', 'Alex', 'Ana', 'Angela', 'Ai', 'Asia', 'Alex', 'Anna', 'Ana', 'Asami', 'Andrea', 'Alex', 'Ana', 'Anya', 'Aiko', 'Ana', 'Angela', 'Ai', 'Alexander', 'Alex', 'Ana', 'Andy']
The dictionary is:
{'Alex': 5, 'Andy': 2, 'Amy': 1, 'Alani': 1, 'Ana': 5, 'Angela': 2, 'Ai': 2, 'Asia': 1, 'Anna': 1, 'Asami': 1, 'Andrea': 1, 'Anya': 1, 'Aiko': 1, 'Alexander': 1}
The top 3 names are: ['Alex', 'Ana', 'Andy'].
The top 4 names make up 50% of the list.
</code></pre>

<p>Another example with a file <a href="korea_most_pop2019.txt">korea_most_pop2019.txt</a>, containing the most popular names in South Korea in 2019, separated by both newlines and spaces:

<pre><code class="blockcode">lst = p1.extract_names('korea_most_pop2019.txt',sep=["\n"," "])
print(lst)
</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">['Ji-an', 'Ha-yoon', 'Seo-ah', 'Ha-eun', 'Seo-yun', 'Ha-rin', 'Ji-yoo', 'Ji-woo', 'Soo-ah', 'Ji-a', 'Seo-jun', 'Ha-joon', 'Do-yun', 'Eun-woo', 'Si-woo', 'Ji-ho', 'Ye-jun', 'Yu-jun', 'Ju-won', 'Min-jun']
</code></pre>


<br>
  <p>Notes:  you should submit a file with only the standard comments at the top, and these functions.  The grading scripts will then import the file for testing and expect the functions to match in name and return values to above:
  <pre><code class="blockcode">
"""
Name:  YOUR NAME
Email: YOUR EMAIL
Resources:  RESOURCES USED
"""

def extract_names(file_name, sep = ["\n"]):
    """
    Opens and reads from file_name, and returns a list of names.

    Keyword arguments:
    sep -- the deliminators for splitting up the data (default ['\n'])
    """

    #Placeholder-- replace with your code
    lst = []
    return lst

def count_names(names_lst):
    """
    Returns a dictionary of names with values the number of times
    each name occurs in the input, names_lst.
    """

    #Placeholder-- replace with your code
    dict = {}
    return dict

def popular_names(names_dict,num = 3):
    """
    Returns a list of the num most popular names as a list of strings.

    Keyword arguments:
    sep -- the number of names to return (default is 3)
    """

    #Placeholder-- replace with your code
    lst = []
    return lst


def percent_captured(names_dict,threshold = 75):
    """
    Returns the number of names needed to have at least threshold percent of
    all the names in the dictionary.

    Keyword arguments:
    threshold -- the percent used for threshold (default 75)
    """

    #Placeholder-- replace with your code
    count = 0
    return count

    </pre></code>
  If your file includes code outside of these functions, either comment the code out before submitting or use a main function that is conditionally executed (see <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//thinkcspy/Functions/mainfunction.html">Think CS: Section 6.8</a> for details).

<p></p><p><a name="p2"><b>Program 2: Parking Tickets.</b></b> &emsp; <i>Due noon, Thursday, 17 February.
  <br>Learning Objective: to refresh students' knowledge of Pandas' functionality to manipulate and create columns from formatted data.
  <br>Available Libraries: Pandas and core Python 3.6+.</i>

  <p> Recent <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/10/13/out-of-state-drivers-are-just-the-worst-at-paying-their-nyc-summonses/">news articles</a> focused on the significantly higher percentage of parking tickets that are unpaid for cars with out-of-state plates:

  <p><img src="http://stjohn.github.io/teaching/data/fall21/streetsblog_unpaid_tickets_20211013.png" height=300px>

  <p>The data is aggregated across the whole city? Does the same occur when the datasets are focused on individual neighborhoods?  To answer that question, as well as what are the most common reasons for tickets, we will use the parking ticket data from OpenData NYC.   In Lecture 3, we started data cleaning efforts on the parking ticket data.  We will continue the data cleaning efforts for this program, as well as introduce auxiliary files that link the codes stored with a short explanation of the violation.  The assignment is broken into the following functions to allow for unit testing:

  <ul>
    <li> <code class = "inline">make_df(file_name)</code>:
    This function takes one input:
          <ul>
              <li> <code class = "inline">file_name</code>: the name of a CSV file containing Parking Ticket Data from OpenData NYC.
          </ul>
    The function should open the file <code class = "inline">file_name</code> as DataFrame, drop all but the columns:
<pre><code class = "datablock">Summons Number,Plate ID,Registration State,Plate Type,Issue Date,Violation Code,Violation Time,
Violation In Front Of Or Opposite,House Number,Street Name,Vehicle Color
</code></pre>
    and return the resulting DataFrame.

    <li> <code class = "inline">filter_reg(df, keep = ["COM", "PAS"])</code>:
    This function takes two inputs:
          <ul>
              <li> <code class = "inline">df</code>: a DataFrame that
                    including the <code class = "inline">Plate Type</code> column.
              <li> <code class = "inline">keep</code>: a list of values for the
                    <code class = "inline">Plate Type</code> column.
                    The default value is <code class = "inline">["COM", "PAS"]</code>.
          </ul>
    The function returns the DataFrame with only rows that have <code class = "inline">Registration</code> with a value from the list <code class = "inline">keep</code>.  All rows where the <code class = "inline">Registration</code> column contains a different value are dropped.

    <li> <code class = "inline">add_indicator(reg_state)</code>:
    This function takes one input:
          <ul>
              <li> <code class = "inline">reg_state</code>: a string containing the state of registation.
          </ul>

    The function should return <code class = "inline">1</code> when <code class = "inline">reg_state</code> is in <code class = "inline">["NY","NJ","CT"]</code> and <code class = "inline">0</code> otherwise.

    <li> <code class = "inline">find_tickets(df, plate_id)</code>:
    This function takes two inputs:
    <ul>
        <li> <code class = "inline">df</code>: a DataFrame that
              including the <code class = "inline">Plate ID</code> column.
        <li> <code class = "inline">plate_id</code>: a string containing a license plate (combination of letters, numbers and spaces).
    </ul>
    returns, as a list, the <code class = "inline">Violation Code</code> for all tickets issued to that <code class = "inline">plate_id</code>.  If that <code class = "inline">plate_id</code> has no tickets in the DataFrame, then an empty list is returned.

    <li> <code class = "inline">make_dict(file_name, skip_rows = 1)</code>:
    This function takes two inputs:
    <ul>
        <li> <code class = "inline">file_name</code>: a string containing the name of a file.
        <li> <code class = "inline">skip_rows</code>: the number of rows to skip at the beginning of file.
        The default value is <code class = "inline">1</code>.
    </ul>
    Make a dictionary from a text file named <code class = "inline">file_name</code>, where each line, after those that are skipped, makes a dictionary entry.  The key for each entry is the string upto the first comma (',') and the value is the string between the first and second commas.  All characters after the second comma on a line are ignored.
  </ul>


  <p>
  For example, assuming your functions are in the <code class="inline">p2.py</code>:
  <pre><code class="blockcode">df = p2.make_df('Parking_Violations_Issued_Precinct_19_2021.csv')
print(df)</code></pre>
  will print:
          <pre><code class="datablock">        Summons Number Plate ID  ...     Street Name Vehicle Color

[451509 rows x 11 columns]</code></pre>

        Note that all the rows are included (451,509) but that only the 11 specified columns are retained in the DataFrame.

    <p>Looking at the registration types (<code class=inline>Plate Type</code>):
        <pre><code class=blockcode>print(f"Registration: {df['Plate Type'].unique()}")
print(f"\n10 Most Common:  {df['Plate Type'].value_counts()[:10]}")</code></pre>
        prints many different types of registrations and abbreviations:
        <pre><code class=datablock>Registration: ['PAS' 'SRF' 'OMS' 'COM' '999' 'SPO' 'OMT' 'MOT' 'RGL' 'PHS' 'MED' 'TRC'

10 Most Common:  PAS    262875
COM    168827
SRF      2834
APP      2800
OMT      2603
OMS      2464
MED      1433
999      1352
CMB      1208
LMB      1135
Name: Plate Type, dtype: int64</code></pre>

    The two registration types that are the most common:
          <pre><code class=blockcode>count = len(df)
pasCount = len(df[df['Plate Type'] == 'PAS'])
comCount = len(df[df['Plate Type'] == 'COM'])
print(f'{count} different vehicles, {100*(pasCount+comCount)/count} percent are passenger or commercial plates.')</code></pre>
    <p>And for the Precinct District 19 dataset that contains almost a half million tickets:
    <pre><code class=datablock>451509 different vehicles, 95.61315499801776 percent are passenger or commercial plates.</code></pre>

    Our function will filter for just passenger and commercial plates:
    <pre><code class="blockcode">dff = p2.filter_reg(df)
print(f'The length of the filtered data frame is {len(dff)}.')</code></pre>

    will print:
    <pre><code class=datablock>The length of the filtered data frame is 431702.</code></pre>

    By specifying different registration types with the keyword argument, we can filter for other registration (<a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/registration/registration-class-codes">DMV's Registration Types</a>) such as motocycles:
    <pre><code class="blockcode">df2 = p2.filter_reg(df,keep=['MOT','HSM','LMA','LMB'])
print(f'The length of the filtered data frame is {len(df2)}.')</code></pre>

    will print:
    <pre><code class=datablock>The length of the filtered data frame is 2095.</code></pre>

    Working the the motocycle DataFrame, we can add a column for if the vehicle is registered in New York:
    <pre><code class="blockcode">df2['NYPlates'] = df2['Registration State'].apply(p2.add_indicator)
print(df2.head())</code></pre>

    will print:
    <pre><code class=datablock>      Summons Number Plate ID  ... Vehicle Color NYPlates
3888      8778381423   MD677M  ...         SILVE        1

7221      8624098440   77BD79  ...         BLACK        1</code></pre>

    We can also look up the tickets that were given, by <code class=inline>Plate ID</code> and use the dictionary of the violation code to find out what the tickets were for:
    <pre><code class="blockcode">print(f'Motorcycles with most tickets:\n {df2["Plate ID"].value_counts()[:5]}')
code_lookup = p2.make_dict('ticket_codes.csv')
ticket_codes = p2.find_tickets(df2,'19UB23')
descrip = [code_lookup[str(t)] for t in ticket_codes]
print(f'The motocycle with plate 19UB23 got the following tickets: {descrip}')</code></pre>

    will print:

    <p>Note: you should submit a file with only the standard comments at the top, this function, and any helper functions you have written. The grading scripts will then import the file for testing.
    If your file includes code outside of functions, either comment the code out before submitting or use a main function that is conditionally executed (see <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//thinkcspy/Functions/mainfunction.html">Think CS: Section 6.8</a> for details).

    <i>Hints:
      <ul>
        <li> Parking ticket data can be found at:  <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2021/kvfd-bves">NYC OpenData</a>.
        <li> Some datasets for testing:
            <ul>
              <li> <a href="parking_test_100.csv">parking_test_100.csv</a>: A truncated file for testing-- first 100 rows of the 2021 UES parking tickets (described below).
              <li> <a href="Parking_Violations_Issued_Precinct_19_2021.csv">Parking_Violations_Issued_Precinct_19_2021.csv</a>:  ~450,000 line file of parking violations issues in 2021 for the Upper East Side (District 19)
            </ul>
        <li> Parking ticket violation codes (<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/vehicles/services-violation-codes.page">summary of codes & fines</a>) are the basis for the dictionary.
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="ticket_codes.csv">ticket_codes.csv</a> from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/widgets/ncbg-6agr">OpenData NYC</a>.
        </ul>

        <li> You may get a warning such as:
          <code class = "datablock">sys:1: DtypeWarning: Columns (39) have mixed types.Specify dtype option on import or set low_memory=False.
          </code>

          when reading in the parking ticket data. Pandas tries to infer the data type (<code class = "inline">dtype</code>) of the columns from the values.  Since some columns are a mixture of numeric and character types this can be difficult.  If the file is read in with <code class = "inline">pd.read_csv(file_name, low_memory=False)</code>, the entire column is read in and used to determine type.
      </ul>
