<p><a name="cw0"><b>Classwork 0: </b> &emsp; <i>Due midnight, Monday, 31 January.</i> &emsp;
  Available on Gradescope, this classwork focuses on the course
  <a href="syl.html">syllabus.</a>

  <br><i>If you do have access to the course on Gradescope, write to <code class="inline">datasci@hunter.cuny.edu</code>.  Include in your email that you not receive a Gradescope invitation, your preferred email, and we will manually generate an invitation.</i>

<p><a name="cw1"><b>Classwork 1: </b> &emsp; <i>Due 4pm, Monday, 31 January.</i> &emsp;
  Available during Lecture 1 on Gradescope (paper version also available for those without a phone or laptop at lecture), this classwork complements the exploratory data analysis of names and foreshadows the sampling of data in Lecture 2.

<p><a name="cw2"><b>Classwork 2: </b> &emsp; <i>Due 4pm, Thursday, 3 February.</i> &emsp;
  Available during Lecture 2 on Gradescope, this classwork introduces the autograder that is used for the programming assignments.
  A paper version will also available for those without use of an IDE during lecture, but, if at all possible, you should work through this using an IDE since the on-line classwork mirrors the structure and content of the upcoming <a href="#p1">Program 1</a>.  <br>(Note:  Hunter College is committed to all students having the technology needed for their courses.

<h2>Homework</h2>
</a>

Unless otherwise noted, programs are submitted on the course's Gradescope site and are written in Python.  The autograders expect a <code class="inline">.py</code> file and do not accept iPython notebooks.
Also, to receive full credit, the code should be compatible with Python 3.6 (the default for the Gradescope autograders).

<p>All students registered by Monday, 26 January are sent a registration invitation to the email on record on their Blackboard account.  If you did not receive the email or would like to use a different account, write to <code class="inline">datasci@hunter.cuny.edu</code>.  Include in your email that you not receive a Gradescope invitation, your preferred email, and we will manually generate an invitation.  As a default, we use your name as it appears in Blackboard/CUNYFirst (to update CUNYFirst, see <a href="https://hunter.</i>cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/changing-your-personal-information/">changing your personal information</a>).  If you prefer a different name for Gradescope, include it in your post, and we will update the Gradescope registration.

<p>To encourage starting early on programs, bonus points are given for early submission.  A point a day, up to a total of 3 bonus points (10% of the program grade), are possible.  The points are prorated by hour.  For example, if you turn in the program 36 hours early, then the bonus poins are: (36 hours/3 days)*3 points = (36 hours/72 hours)*3 points = 1.5 points.

<p>
To get full credit for a program, the file must include in the opening comment:
<ul>
    <li> Your name, as it appears in your Gradescope registration.
    <li> The email you are using for Gradescope.
    <li> A list of any resources you used for the program.  Include classmates and tutors that you worked with, along with any websites or tutorials that you used.  If you used no resources (other than the class notes and textbooks), then you should include the line:  "No resources used."
</ul>

For example, for the student, Thomas Hunter, the opening comment of his first program might be:
<pre><code class="blockcode">
"""
Name:  Thomas Hunter
Email: thomas.hunter.</i>1870@hunter.</i>cuny.edu
Resources:  Used python.org as a reminder of Python 3 print statements.
"""
</pre></code>
and then followed by his Python program.

<p></p><p><a name="p1"><b>Program 1: Popular Names.</b></b> &emsp; <i>Due noon, Thursday, 10 February.
  <br>Learning Objective: to build competency with string and file I/O functionality of core Python.
  <br>Available Libraries:  Core Python 3.6+ only.</i>

  <p>
  In lecture and <a href="">Chapter 1</a> of the textbook, we looked at first names for students taking data science at UC Berkeley as well as the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/index.html">baby names data set</a> from the Social Security Administration.  We explored properties such as the lengths of names:

  <p><img src="namesNumChars.png" height=300>

  <p>For this program, we will focus on the most common names in a given file, as well the names that make up a fixed fraction of the names. To allow for unit testing, the assignment is broken into the following functions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <code class = "inline">extract_names(file_name, sep = ["\n"])</code>:  Returns a list of names.  Assumes that the names are separated by the separators listed in <code class = "inline">sep</code>.  The default value is <code class = "inline">["\n"]</code> but the possible inputs are 1 or more separators.  Your function should remove any empty strings from the list.
    <li> <code class = "inline">count_names(names_lst)</code>:
      Returns a dictionary of names with values the number of times each name occurs in the input, <code class = "inline">names_lst</code>.
    <li> <code class = "inline">popular_names(names_dict,num = 3)</code>:
      Returns a list of the <code class="inline">num</code> most popular names as a list of strings.  If no value is passed for <code class="inline">num</code>, the default value of 3 is used (that is, it returns the 3 most popular names).
    <li> <code class = "inline">percent_captured(names_dict,threshold = 75)</code>:
      Returns the number of names needed to have at least <code class="inline">threshold</code> percent of all the names in the dictionary.  If no value is passed for <code class="inline">percent</code>, the default value of 75 is used (that is, it returns the number of names needed to have 75 percent (or more) of the total occurrances of names).
  </ul>

  <p>For example, assuming these functions are in a file, <code class="inline">p1.py</code> and run on a file containing names that start with 'A', <a href="a_names.txt">a_names.txt</a>:

<pre><code class="blockcode">lst = p1.extract_names('a_names.txt')
print(f'The list is:\n{lst}')
dict = p1.count_names(lst)
print(f'The dictionary is:\n{dict}')
lstTop = p1.popular_names(dict)
print(f'The top 3 names are: {lstTop}.')
num = p1.percent_captured(dict, threshold = 50)
print(f'The top {num} names make up 50% of the list.')
</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">The list is:
['Alex', 'Andy', 'Amy', 'Alani', 'Alex', 'Ana', 'Angela', 'Ai', 'Asia', 'Alex', 'Anna', 'Ana', 'Asami', 'Andrea', 'Alex', 'Ana', 'Anya', 'Aiko', 'Ana', 'Angela', 'Ai', 'Alexander', 'Alex', 'Ana', 'Andy']
The dictionary is:
{'Alex': 5, 'Andy': 2, 'Amy': 1, 'Alani': 1, 'Ana': 5, 'Angela': 2, 'Ai': 2, 'Asia': 1, 'Anna': 1, 'Asami': 1, 'Andrea': 1, 'Anya': 1, 'Aiko': 1, 'Alexander': 1}
The top 3 names are: ['Alex', 'Ana', 'Andy'].
The top 4 names make up 50% of the list.
</code></pre>

<p>Another example with a file <a href="korea_most_pop2019.txt">korea_most_pop2019.txt</a>, containing the most popular names in South Korea in 2019, separated by both newlines and spaces:

<pre><code class="blockcode">lst = p1.extract_names('korea_most_pop2019.txt',sep=["\n"," "])
print(lst)
</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">['Ji-an', 'Ha-yoon', 'Seo-ah', 'Ha-eun', 'Seo-yun', 'Ha-rin', 'Ji-yoo', 'Ji-woo', 'Soo-ah', 'Ji-a', 'Seo-jun', 'Ha-joon', 'Do-yun', 'Eun-woo', 'Si-woo', 'Ji-ho', 'Ye-jun', 'Yu-jun', 'Ju-won', 'Min-jun']
</code></pre>


<br>
  <p>Notes:  you should submit a file with only the standard comments at the top, and these functions.  The grading scripts will then import the file for testing and expect the functions to match in name and return values to above:
  <pre><code class="blockcode">
"""
Name:  YOUR NAME
Email: YOUR EMAIL
Resources:  RESOURCES USED
"""

def extract_names(file_name, sep = ["\n"]):
    """
    Opens and reads from file_name, and returns a list of names.

    Keyword arguments:
    sep -- the deliminators for splitting up the data (default ['\n'])
    """

    #Placeholder-- replace with your code
    lst = []
    return lst

def count_names(names_lst):
    """
    Returns a dictionary of names with values the number of times
    each name occurs in the input, names_lst.
    """

    #Placeholder-- replace with your code
    dict = {}
    return dict

def popular_names(names_dict,num = 3):
    """
    Returns a list of the num most popular names as a list of strings.

    Keyword arguments:
    sep -- the number of names to return (default is 3)
    """

    #Placeholder-- replace with your code
    lst = []
    return lst


def percent_captured(names_dict,threshold = 75):
    """
    Returns the number of names needed to have at least threshold percent of
    all the names in the dictionary.

    Keyword arguments:
    threshold -- the percent used for threshold (default 75)
    """

    #Placeholder-- replace with your code
    count = 0
    return count

    </pre></code>
  If your file includes code outside of these functions, either comment the code out before submitting or use a main function that is conditionally executed (see <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//thinkcspy/Functions/mainfunction.html">Think CS: Section 6.8</a> for details).

<h2>Project</h2>
</a>

A final project is optional for this course. The grade for the project is a combination of grades earned on the milestones (e.g. deadlines during the semester to keep the projects on track) and the overall submitted program. If you choose not to complete the project, your final exam grade will replace its portion of the overall grade.
