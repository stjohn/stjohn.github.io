<h2>Quizzes</h2>
</a>

Unless otherwise noted, quizzes focus on the corresponding programming assignment.  They are 30 minutes long and cannot be repeated.  They are available for the 24 hours after lecture and assess your programming skill using HackerRank. Access information for each quiz will be available under the Quizzes menu on  Blackboard.


<!--
  This quiz covers data representation from Lecture #5 and <a href=
  "http://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/07/repr_intro.html">DS 100, Chapter 7</a> (Data Representation).</p>

<h2>Homework</h2>
</a>

Unless otherwise noted, programs are submitted on the course's Gradescope site and are written in Python.
Also, to receive full credit, the code should be compatible with Python 3.6 (the default for the Gradescope autograders).

<p>All students registered by Monday, 26 January are sent a registration invitation to the email on record on their Blackboard account.  If you did not receive the email or would like to use a different account, post to <code class="inline">Help::Individual Questions</code> (on the left hand menu when logged into the course site on Blackboard).  Include in your post that you not receive a Gradescope invitation, your preferred email, and we will manually generate an invitation.  As a default, we use your name as it appears in Blackboard/CUNYFirst (to update CUNYFirst, see <a href="https://hunter.</i>cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/changing-your-personal-information/">changing your personal information</a>).  If you prefer a different name for Gradescope, include it in your post, and we will update the Gradescope registration.



<p>
To get full credit for a program, the file must include in the opening comment:
<ul>
    <li> Your name, as it appears in your Gradescope registration.
    <li> The email you are using for Gradescope.
    <li> A list of any resources you used for the program.  Include classmates and tutors that you worked with, along with any websites or tutorials that you used.  If you used no resources (other than the class notes and textbooks), then you should include the line:  "No resources used."
</ul>

For example, for the student, Thomas Hunter, the opening comment of his first program might be:
<pre><code class="blockcode">
"""
Name:  Thomas Hunter
Email: thomas.hunter.</i>1870@hunter.</i>cuny.edu
Resources:  Used python.org as a reminder of Python 3 print statements.
"""
</pre></code>
and then followed by his Python program.

<h2>Project</h2>
</a>

A final project is optional for this course. The grade for the project is a combination of grades earned on the milestones (e.g. deadlines during the semester to keep the projects on track) and the overall submitted program. If you choose not to complete the project, your final exam grade will replace its portion of the overall grade.
