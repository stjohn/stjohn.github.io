<h3>Announcements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> December 8:  We have a classroom (1036HN) for the spring semester and will be <b>in-person</b>!  Thank you to President Raab for making this possible.

    <!--Due to limited space on-campus for large lectures, this course
    does not yet have a classroom and is currently listed as "on-line" on CUNYFirst.  We hope that a room will be found soon and that we will be in-person.
  -->
  <li> The course prerequisites for this programming-intensive class are:
      <p>
      <ul>
          <li> a year of college-level programming in the same language (CSci 127 & 133) or (CSci 135 & 235)),
          <li> at least one semester in Python (i.e. CSci 127), and
          <li> a course in statistics (i.e. Stat 213 or equivalent).
      </ul>
      <!--<p>
      There is a lot of material to cover, so, we start programming during the first lecture and missing the programming prerequisites will make it extremely difficult to complete the programming component and pass the class.  We assume familiarity with statistics from the first week onward and integrate it into examples, quizzes, and programs.  Given its use throughout the course, lack of statistical familiarity will lower your grade by at least a letter grade.
    -->
  <p> If you are interested in the course and have a year of programming, Python proficiency, and taken statistics, but they don't align with the Hunter prerequisites, you can enroll via CUNYFirst.  If you took the courses elsewhere, reach out to a computer science advisors about what's needed for permissions.

<!--
  <p> If you haven't take a year of programming, or lack proficiency in Python or statistics, it is unfair to admit a student into a course that they are unlikely to pass, and we hope that you will join the course in a future semester when you have completed the prerequisites.
-->


  <li> Enrollment for the course is via CUNYFirst.  Spring enrollment
    opens in mid-November.
  <!--
  <li> The course is full, and we do not expect additional seats to become available for the fall term.  We anticipate that the course will be offered again in the spring.
  Enrollment for the course is via CUNYFirst.  If the course is at capacity, sign up for the wait list.  Those on the wait list have first priority when seats become available.</li>
  <li> Enrolled Students:  for the quickest response to questions, use the links on the course Blackboard page:
      <ul>
          <li> For questions of general interest, use <code class="inline">Help::General Questions</code>.
          <li> For questions specific to you (e.g. resending Gradescope invitations, questions about grading, etc.), use <code class="inline">Help::Individual Questions</code>.
      </ul>
