<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the textbook and other assigned reading. Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience. Students should review topics from prior courses as needed using old notes and books.

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
are responsible for knowing and following Lehman's 
<a href="http://www.lehman.edu/academics/arts-humanities/documents/CUNYPolicyonAcademicIntegrity.pdf">Academic Integrity Policy</a>,
(available from the
Undergraduate Bulletin, Graduate Bulletin, or the Office of Academic
Standards and Evaluations). 
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice President of
Student Affairs. 

<p><b>Homework:</b>  Programming exercises are posted on the class
website, usually two weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture.  Note that as the semester progresses, the
programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to
complete.  To receive full credit for a program, the program must 
perform correctly, must include comments, and be written in good style.  Accompanying written analysis is expected to be written in standard written English (i.e. use complete sentences and proper grammar).
Unless otherwise noted, homework is due weekly by <b>10:30am, Thursdays</b>, and are submitted via Blackboard.
<!--Approximately 12 programs will be graded thoroughly and returned with 
comments.  The top 10
grades will be counted for the homework score.-->
<b>No late homework is accepted.</b>

<p><b>Quizzes:</b> Instead of mid-term examinations, weekly quizzes will be used to assess mastery of the material
<ul>
	<li> The quizzes have a 20 minute time-limit and are available via Blackboard.
	<li>
	As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.  
	<li> Quizzes may be taken as multiple times before the deadline.
		<b>There are no make-up quizzes.</b> 
	<li> All quizzes are open book, open notes, and you may use the Python shell.
	<li> Unless otherwise noted, quizzes are due <b>noon, Saturdays</b>.

</ul>

<p><b>Project:</b>  A final project is required for this course.  The grade for the project is a combination of grades earned on the milestones (e.g. deadlines during the semester to keep the projects on track) and the overall submitted program.

</ul>
<p><b>Final Exam:</b> As with all undergraduate courses at Lehman College, the final exam is required.  The registrar has assigned the final examination time of:
<blockquote>
Thursday, 26 May, 11am-1pm.
</blockquote>



<p><b>Grades:</b>  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Problem Sets: 30% </li>
      <li>Quizzes: 20% </li>
      <li>Project: 20% </li>
      <li>Final Exam: 30%</li>      
    </ul>
  </li>

	<p> 
	You must take and pass the final to pass the course.

<h3>Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities</h3>

<p><b>Textbook:</b> The textbook is <a href="http://joelgrus.com/2015/04/26/data-science-from-scratch-first-principles-with-python/">Data Science From Scratch</a> by Joel Grus.

(ISBN 978-1491901427).  Approximate price: $30 (available on-line from 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> & <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033400.do">O'Reilly</a>).  

<p>
<b>Technology:</b> This course uses the <b>Python</b> programming language available from 
<a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a>.  	
We will be using the <a href="http://www.numpy.org">numpy</a>, <a href="http://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>, and <a href="http://www.scipy.org">scipy</a> libraries.  These do not come with the default installations of python, but comes with <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">anaconda</a> or visit the download pages of these libraries.
	
<p>	If you would prefer not to upgrade your Python installation (or would like to work through a browswer), there are several web-based services.  One that already has the libraries were are using is <a href="http://www.pythonanywhere.com">PythonAnywhere</a>.
 


<p><b>Computer Access:</b> Part of this course will use university
computer laboratories. These machines are for work related to
this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the
department and on-campus. Misusing university computers could
result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term, making
it exceedingly difficult to complete this course.


<p><b>Accommodating Disabilities:</b>  Lehman College is committed to providing access to all programs and curricula to all students.  Students with disabilities who may need classroom accommodations are encouraged to register with the Office of Student Disability Services.  For more info, please contact the Office of Student Disability Services, Shuster Hall, Room 238, phone number, 718-960-8441.
