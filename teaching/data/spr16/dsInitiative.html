<h1>The Data Science Initiative @ Lehman College, CUNY</h1>

<p>
The Data Science Initiative serves students across the Lehman College campus who 
want to analyze big data sets, either as part of their current studies, or in their future careers.   This initiative is a collaborative effort across the Natural and Social Sciences and seeks to organize coursework and internships that are often scattered and difficult for students to assemble: providing the skills to acquire, manage, analyse and make inferences from big data.  
<!--We hope these courses will form the foundation of a proposed minor in data science.-->

<h2>Current Courses</h2>

<p>The courses emphasize programming proficiency and statistics for large data, 
and include:

<ul>
	<li> <a href="">Foundations of Data Science:</a>  A self-contained course teaching programming competency and statistical inference tools for acquiring, analyzing, inferring, and visualizing large data sets.  The course teaches <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> and Python's most common packages for scraping data, statistical analysis and visualization.  The course also covers the popular code sharing site, <a href="http://github.org">github</a> (and its simple language, Markdown, for formatting webpages) and the statistical programming language, <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>. The course is being piloted Spring 2017 as a section of the programming for non-majors course, CMP 108.  
	<br><i>Note: This course is not intended for computer science majors.  Those interested in pursuing computer science should take the <a href="http://lehman.edu/academics/mathematics-computer-science/java-help.php">Java programming sequence</a>, beginning with CMP 167.</i> 
	
	<li>  Several statistics courses exist (MAT 327 and MAT 330) or are under development focusing on techniques for making inferences from data. 
	
	<li>  <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/owen/teaching/datasci/sp2017.html">Data Science:</a> Piloted as a mathematics and as a computer science topics course in Spring 2016, this course is being offered again in Spring 2017.  It assumes profiency in Python and includes a fast-paced review of standard numeric and visualization packages (<a href="http://www.numpy.org">numpy</a> and <a href="http://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>) before moving on to the statistical and visualization tools needed for machine learning (<a href="http://pandas.pydata.org">pandas</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org">scipy</a>, in particular <a href="">sklearn</a>, as well as <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/">bokeh</a> and 
	<a href="http://seaborn.pydata.org">seaborn</a>).  
	
	<br><i>Note: If you do not have a strong background in either Python or statistics, you should take the Foundations of Data Science course first.</i>
<!--	
	<li>  Topics Courses:-->
</ul>

The above courses, focused on using mathematics, statistics, and computation to analyze big data sets, complement the courses offered by the mathematics and computer science department.  The mathematics program produces many strong high school teachers who regularly go on to advanced study in mathematics and education. The computer science program offers majors in computer science and  information sciences and produces many computer programmers and IT specialists. 



<h2>Supporting Departments & Grants</h2>

The Data Science Initiative was fostered by a <a href="http://www2.cuny.edu/about/administration/chancellor/strategic-investment-initiative/">CUNY Strategic Investment Initiative grant</a> (awarded to the Division of Natural and Social Sciences to "open new pathways to careers in science-related fields").  
Current work is  partially supported by $5.8 million, 5-year <a href="http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/forum/2016/10/25/lehman-college-receives-over-5-million-dollars-for-hsi-stem-grant/">HSI STEM grant</a> from the Department of Education.  Awarded in October 2016, the grant seeks to boost enrollment, retention, and graduation rates in STEM.  

<p>
The initiative is chaired by <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/academics/sociology/faculty-waring.php">Prof. Elin Waring</a> (chair of sociology) and <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/">Prof. Katherine St. John</a> (math & computer science) with support from Associate Dean Chris Malone and Dr. Violet Frederick (<a href="http://www.lehman.edu/academics/natural-social-sciences/index.php">Division of Natural & Social Science</a>).  Faculty involved include:
<ul>
	<li>Mathematics & Computer Science:  Profs. Megan Owen & Katherine St. John
	<li>Political Science:  Associate Dean Chris Malone
	<li>Sociology:  Profs, Naomi Spence & Elin Waring (chair)
</ul>
