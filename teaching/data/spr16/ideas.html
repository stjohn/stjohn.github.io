All assignments are based around NYC data.

Ideas:
<ul>
	<li> HW #1:  weather data, plot birthday + histogram
	<li> HW #2:  data as vectors:  z-scores of temperature compared to average for month; running average; date versus min temp, size of bubble is snow depth;<br>
	historical population data for nyc as a vector, wiki, 1790 to 2010,
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City, show percentage changing-- normalize to each year by sum, graph percentages... 
	<li> HW #3:  binning data:  nyc crash data, has time, borough, gis, cause, bin by minute, bin by borough, bin by crash type, use animate to show how changed over month when binned by day-- should see the blizzard affect on traffic...
	<li> HW #4:  Correlations for population growth, Lyme disease, crash data
	Does temperature affect number of crashes?  Is snow depth correlated with min temp (January data)
	<li> HW #5: Bayes Theorem & Regular Expressions
	<li> HW #6: A/B Testing & Name Classifier:  some written problems given numbers for A/B situations, a name classifier-- give the function that reads in a name file gives gender probs for last character to build the classifier, then students modify?  Or give outline and they fill in?  
	<li> HW #7: Gradient Descent & numpy
	<li> HW #8: Mapping data
	<li> HW #9: PCA?
	<li>  Does temperature or rain affect subway ridership more?  Does it affect citibike ridership?  Pick October (could extend to whole year).  Are they correlated?  Are there confounding factors that could skew data?
	Need some Bayes thm in here, 
	Locales:  bin data to show where the most crashes occurred over the day, use most_common from collections.
	<li> D3 in Python?  bokeh?
	<li> Introduce heat maps at some point?	
	<li> Population pyramid of NYC, over time, animate?  Use scipy?  Age distribution over time, on map of NYC
	<li> Histograms of bus arrival times by borough
	<li> Histograms by bus stop arrival-- how late?
	<li> Mapping population density of boroughs-- using JSON data, use Mike B's simplifier to keep 
	from bogging down matplotlib.  Plot polygons.  Use census block data?
	When drawing, using PolyCollection:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12881848/draw-polygons-more-efficiently-with-matplotlib
	Also paths:  http://matplotlib.org/users/path_tutorial.html
	Base map?
	<li> Flood plains-- is there elevation data/topo maps for NYC?
	<li> Mapping school zones versus test score, high school grad rates
	<li> Drawing networks with networkX:  do adjacency matrix and multiply to show in-direct connections, animate?
	<li> NYC collisions by borough by time of day, then display on a map, use animation module?  Basemap?
	<li> How much garbage leaves NYC?  Seasonal Flu Vaccine Locations,
	<li> Change in mpg of the NYC taxi fleet over time?
	<li> Subway frequency by line
	<li> Yahoo webscope data
	<li> Subway ridership since 1985
	<li> Free Wifi by borough
	<li> Have the boroughs of NYC change color as the percentage population changes (use bokeh to redo NYC pop data)
	<li> A student had done 30% of the homework for the course and wants to know if they should continue.  From prior data, you have that the probability if a student submits less than 50% of the homework they have 5% pass chance of doing well on the final.  Need to flip to be Bayes...  
	Examining students' performance in a large programming class, you notice that submitting homework seems to be correlated with scoring well on the final.  Use gradient descent to find the least squares best fit?
	<li>  Use gradient descent for predicting a stock price.
	<li> Voronoi diagrams around trash cans, do with k-means clustering
	<li> Voronoi with subways, schools-- what every data point is easiest.
	<li> Voronoi-- school zones, divided by distance to closest school
	<li> CUNY-- zones for each senior campus (voronoi)
	<li> Clustering with map data points-- wifi points in city?  collisions?
	<li> Vis transit:
	http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/03/17/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/20070318_TRAIN_GRAPHIC.html
	
	<li> Urban planning and python class:
