<h3>Data</h3>

<p>For this assignment, you will need two different data sets:
<ol>
	<li> The historical population for New York City used in <a href="hw2.html">Homework #2</a>.
	<li> Image files from <a href="http://remotesensing.usgs.gov/">USGS Remote Sensing Program</a> (see below for specific images).
  
</ol>

<p>
We will use these data sets for later homework assignments.  Since scraping the data takes time, save these data sets to use again for the future programs.

<td colspan=2>
Using gradient descent compute the linear regression for the historical Bronx population versus the total New York City population.  Display a plot containing the pairs <tt>(bx[i],nyc[i])</tt> where <tt>bx[i]</tt> is the Bronx population in year <tt>i</tt> and <tt>nyc[i]</tt> is the total New York city population in year i (Hint: use a scatter plot to show this part).  Include on your plot the linear regression line that you computed.
<br><br>
Make sure to include in the title of your plot the date plotted. <br><br>
#1:  Submit your Python program as a <b>.py</b> file.<br>
#2:  Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.<br>

The USGS collected images before and after the 
	Both:  New Year's flooding:  <a href="http://remotesensing.usgs.gov/gallery/gallery.php?cat=3#481"> New Year's flooding</a> (saved as png <a href="Midwest_Flooding_12082015_sm.png">for December, 2015</a> and <a href="Midwest_Flooding_01012016_sm.png">for January, 2016</a>).  Write a program that produces an image with flooded regions marked in red (that is, any pixel that is not "blue" in 2015 but is in the 2016 image).

The USGS remote sensing gallery contains an image of 
<a href="http://remotesensing.usgs.gov/gallery/gallery.php?cat=7#438">New York City</a>.  Filter this <a href="New_York_City_NY_sm.png">image</a> to be a ninth of its original size by saving one pixel out of every 3 x 3 subset.

Using gradient descent, find the <b>two</b> local mimima of the function:
<pre>
f(x,y) = 2*x**2 - 4*x*y + y**4 + 2
</pre>create a 3D plot of this function and do gradient descent to find the minima.<br>
#5: Include a screen shot of a plot of the function, marking the minimum points<br>
Hint:  See <a href="3dSurface.py">3dSurface.py</a> example.<br>
#6: Include a detailed explanation of the gradient descent approach you used including the gradient of the function, step size, and starting points.<br>

<h3>Submitting Homework</h3>

To submit your homework, log on to the Blackboard system, and go to "Homework".  For each part of the homework, there is a separate input box.  You may submit the homework as many times as you would like before the deadline.
