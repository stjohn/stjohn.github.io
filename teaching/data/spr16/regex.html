Name Data:  The Social Security Administration keeps track of birth names by year and state.  Before we work directly with the data, try the Baby Name Voyager visualization tool:
What is the most popular girls’ name now?  In 1990?  In 1960?
When did the name `Eden’ break into the top 1000 names?
What occurs more:  names starting with `C’ or with `J’?

Using Regular Expressions for Name Data:
Pattern
What names will these match?
Ed[ei]n


Erin.*


Stephan[(ie)y]


Isabel{1,2}e*


Ta[a-z]{4,10}


[JY]asmine*


[A-Z].*elle


[A-Z][a-z]*[aey]



Which of these patterns are easy to find using the name visualization?   Which are hard?  Why?



Challenges:  To find these patterns, we will use the Social Security Administration’s raw data:
Run the program, searchingNames.py.  What does it do?
Are there more names ending in -elle or -ella?
To count only girls’ names, you can filter lines by:
		words = line.split(‘,’)
		if words[1] == ‘F’:
		     … process data ....
	Is the name Taylor more common for girls or boys?
Are there more boys named Daniel in 2000, 2005, or 2010?







Harder Challenges:
Graph the number of names ending with -elle versus names ending with -ella from 1990 to 2010 using matplotlib.
Graph the number of names starting with ‘J’ from 1990 to 2010 using matplotlib.
Choose a name (e.g.. Daniel) and use matplotlib to graph the number of babies call that name from 1990 to 2010.  
Compare graphically the popularity of two names (e.g. Theodore versus Franklin) from 1990 to 2010.
