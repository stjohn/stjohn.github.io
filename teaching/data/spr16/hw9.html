<h3>Data</h3>

<p>For this assignment, you will need to download three different data sets:
<ol>
	<li> <b>New York Federal Reserve Labor Market for Recent Graduates</b>:  Download the excel file at the bottom of the page and convert to CSV to use in the problem set below:
	<blockquote><a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/college-labor-market_compare-majors.html">https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/college-labor-market_compare-majors.html</a>
	</blockquote>
	<li> <b>Shapemaps for New York City School Districts</b>: This page includes the shapefiles as well as a CSV file (useful for exploring what data fields are available for each region):
	<blockquote>
	<a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2013-2014-School-Zones/pp5b-95kq">https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2013-2014-School-Zones/pp5b-95kq</a>
	</blockquote>	
	<li> <b>Test Scores for New York City School Districts</b>:  For this homework, we will be using the District "Math Data Files":
	<blockquote>
	<a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults">http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults</a>	
	</blockquote>
</ol>

<p>
We will use these data sets for later homework assignments.  Since scraping the data takes time, save these data sets to use again for the future programs.

<h3>Assignment</h3>

<p> 
The work to be submitted differs by whether you are enrolled in the computer science or mathematics course.

<td colspan=2>
Analyse the NY Fed's Labor Market Data for Recent Graduates (see link above) using a Principal Components Analysis.  There are three parts to this exercise:
<ol>
	<li>  Compute and display the covariance matrix for the data, 
	<li>  Generate a 3D plot of the data under the first three axis of a Principal Components Analysis.  On this plot, highlight (using a different color) the computer science and mathematics majors, and 
	<li>  Include the Python code that you used to generate your plots.
</ol>
 
Make sure to include in the title of your plot the date plotted. <br><br>
#1:  Submit your Python program as a <b>.py</b> file.<br>
#2:  Submit a text file or screen shot that includes the covariance matrix.<br>
#3:  Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.<br> 
</tr>

<tr>
<th>#4-5</th>
<td colspan=2>
Using <tt>basemap</tt>, create a map of the New York City School Districts (elementary and middle school) and shade each districts by borough (that is, all districts in the Bronx will be the same color; the districts in Brooklyn will be another color, etc.).
<br><br>

#4:  Submit your Python program as a <b>.py</b> file.<br>
#5:  Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.
</td>

</tr>

<th>#6-7</th>
<td>
Using the New York City data for district test scores, shade your map above by percentage of students proficient in mathematics (i.e. scored a 3 or 4 on the exam-- the last column in the CSV file).
<br><br>
#6:  Submit your Python program as a <b>.py</b> file.<br>
#7:  Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.  
</td>
<td>



#6:  Using the New York City data for district test scores, compute the covariance matrix for District 1 schools across grades (that is, rows 8 to 28, columns G onward).  Which rows are most highly correlated?  Submit a typeset or neatly handwritten image of your answer.<br><br>
#7:  Compute the first and second axis of a Principal Components Analysis using the covariance matrix above.  Submit a typeset or neatly handwritten image of your answer.

<h3>Submitting Homework</h3>

To submit your homework, log on to the Blackboard system, and go to "Homework".  For each part of the homework, there is a separate input box.  You may submit the homework as many times as you would like before the deadline.
