<h3>Standard Representation</h3>

<p>
There are two canonical ways to represent graphs (networks) and trees:
<ul>
	<li> <b>Adjacency Matrices:</b>  An array, <tt>adjMatrix</tt> is used to hold the graph.  The array is n x n where n is the number of vertices.  For each edge, (i,j), the ith, jth entry entry, <tt>adjMatrix[i,j]</tt> contains the length or weight of the edge.  If there is no edge between i and j, then <tt>adjMatrix[i,j] = 0</tt>.
	
	<li> <b>Adjacency Lists:</b> For each vertex, a list of the adjacent vertices is stored.  We will use a dictionary to simplify the look up of adjacencies.
</ul>

<p>
Below, there are several examples to think through in pairs or in triples.
</div>

<h3>Adjacency Matrices</h3>

<p>
Can you get here from there?  Say you an airlines that flies:

<ul>
	<li> New York to/from Chicago
	<li> New York to/from Houston
	<li> Chicago to/from San Jose
	<li> Houston to/from San Jose
</ul>
Can you fly from New York to San Jose?  Well, not directly, but it is possible if you change plans in Chicago or Houston.  We can represent this in a matrix with entries of 1 if there is a flight and 0 if there is not:

<p>
<table border="1px">
<tr>
	<th></th><th>New York</th> <th>Chicago</th> <th>Houston</th> <th>San Jose</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>New York</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Chicago</th><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Houston</th><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>San Jose</th><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
We're making the assumption that if you start in a city, you can stay in the city (i.e. there is a `self-loop' from New York to New York).  You can also model this without self-loops, depending on the application.

<p>Let's use a dictionary so, we don't have to remember which index corresponds to which city:
<pre>
cityNum = {}
cityNum["New York"] = 0
cityNum["Chicago"] = 1
cityNum["Houston"] = 2
cityNum["San Jose"] = 3
</pre>
<p>
Using <tt>numpy</tt>, the matrix (without labels):
<pre>
import numpy as np
flights = np.zeros( (4,4) )

flights[cityNum["NYC"],cityNum["Chicago"]] = 1
flights[cityNum["NYC"],cityNum["Houston"]] = 1
flights[cityNum["Chicago"],cityNum["NYC"]] = 1
flights[cityNum["Chicago"],cityNum["NYC"]] = 1
flights[cityNum["Houston"],cityNum["NYC"]] = 1
flights[cityNum["Houston"],cityNum["San Jose"]] = 1
flights[cityNum["San Jose"],cityNum["Chicago"]] = 1
flights[cityNum["San Jose"],cityNum["Houston"]] = 1

#Create the self-loops:
for i in range(4): flights[i,i] = 1
</pre>
(complete program in <a href="../amnh/flights.py">flights.py</a>).

<p>We can reach San Francisco from New York by taking flights to an intermediary city (in this case, Chicago or Houston) and then continuing on.  That is:
<blockquote>
	There are flights: (NYC -> Chicago and Chicago -> San Jose) or (NYC -> Houston and Houston -> San Jose)
</blockquote>

In the matrix, we have existing flights as 1 and no flight as 0, so instead of the <tt>and</tt>, we can multiply and just check that sum is greater than 0 (the sum is non-zero only when one of the terms is, which happens exactly when there's flights via the intermediary cities):
<blockquote>
	(NYC -> Chicago * Chicago -> San Jose) + (NYC -> Houston * Houston -> San Jose) > 0
</blockquote>

<p>
In terms of math, we are taking a vector of the outgoing flights from a city and combining it with a vector of the incoming flights to the next city.  This combination is called the <tt>dot product</tt>:
<pre>
	v dot w = v1*w1 + v2*w2 + ... vN*wN
</pre>
where the vectors are v = (v1, v2, ... vN) and w = (w1, w2,... wN).

<p>
In <tt>numpy</tt>, there is a built-in function for taking the dot product of matrices (often called `multiplying matrices', though the numpy matrix multiplication does something very different).

<p>
This is a lovely feature of using adjacency matrices to reprensent graphs.  If there is an edge from a to b and an edge from b to c, then a to c is non-zero in the matrix A.dot(A).  Why?  The i,jth element of the A.dot(A) is the dot product of the row indexed by i by the column index by j, which is:
<blockquote>
	A[i,0]*A[0,j] + A[i,1]*A[1,j] + A[i,2]*A[2,j] + ... + A[i,n-1]*A[n-1,j] 
</blockquote>
This entry is not zero, only when one of the terms of the sum is not zero (there's no cancelling since all distances are positive).  

<p>
The result of A.dot(A) is:
<p>
<table border="1px">
<tr>
	<th></th><th>New York</th> <th>Chicago</th> <th>Houston</th> <th>San Jose</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>New York</th><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Chicago</th><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Houston</th><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>San Jose</th><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
That is, we can get from every city to every other city (the values indicate the number of different ways to do so, including taking the 'self-loops' or empty flights).

<p>
Before continuing, let's draw the cities we have.  To do, we'll use <tt>basemap</tt> focused on the US (complete program in 
<a href="flights.py">flights.py</a>).  In github, there is already a dictionary set up with entries for cities and there longitude and latitudes
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ecarter/413343">major_us_city_dma_codes</a>.
Instead of typing the coordinates in by hand, we will access the dictionary entries for each city we're mapping.

<ol>
	<li> Set up a dictionary with city names and coordinates from file.
	<li> Set up a basemap with state boundaries.
	<li> Include our flight table as a numpy array.
	<li> Draw a marker on each city in the flights table.
	<li> For each edge in the table, draw a great circle between the cities.
	<li> <i>TO DO: Compute the cities that can be reached in two flights.</i>
	<li> <i>TO DO: Draw the cities and great circles for those flights.</i>
</ol>

<p>
Try the program and see how it works.
<!--Convenient to set up functions for getting coordinates given a list of cities, as well for drawing the city markers and great circles.-->

<p>


<h4>Challenges</h4>

<ul>
	<li>  Add three additional cities to the <tt>flights</tt> table.  Not all cities appear in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/ecarter/413343">major_us_city_dma_codes</a> file, so, make sure to choose cities that do.  Add in extra flights between the cities (only modifying the <tt>flights</tt> and <tt>cityNum</tt> data structures) and display.
	<li>  Change your program so it displays all cities that can be reached in 3 or fewer flights (i.e. use <tt>flights.dot(flights).dot(flights)</tt> instead of <tt>flights</tt> for your edges between cities).
	<li>  You have frequent flier miles that allow you to fly on many, but not all flights on a certain airlines.  Can you fly from New York to Portland using only flights from the listed in <a href="../amnh/cityPairs.txt">cityPairs.txt</a>?  Use your program from above to answer the question.
	<br>
	<i>Hint:  If you find entering all the city-pairs by hand into the <tt>flights</tt> table tedious, assign numbers to each city (either by reading in the file and using those or setting by hand), then read in the file line-by-line and set <tt>flights[c1,c2] = 1</tt> if <tt>c1</tt> and <tt>c2</tt> occur together on the line.</i>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Adjacency Lists</h3>

<p>
A good use of adjacency lists is for storing sparsely populated graphs, such as trees.  We will write a function that prints out all the leaves in a clade of a tree.

<p>
It is not hard, but a bit tedious, to parse a tree in Newick format (since you need to worry about extra spaces, names of more than one character, etc.).  The file <a href="../amnh/adjTrees.py">adjTrees.py</a> has a tree already stored as an adjacency list in the dictionary <tt>tree</tt>.  Pictorally, the tree is:
<br>
<p>
<img src= "../amnh/vertEvolTree.png">
<br>
(<a href="http://paleobiology.si.edu/dinosaurs/interactives/tree_life/tree.html">Image from Smithsonian Institute</a>)
<p>
The entries in our dictionary have the following structure:
<pre>
	(parentName,[child1,child2,...])
</pre>
If there are no children, the last part of the tuple is an empty list.

<p>
The goal is to write a function that given a vertex name, <tt>v</tt>, to print out all leaves below it.  Let's break this into parts:

<pre>
printLeaves(v):
    If v is a leaf, print out v
    Else, for each child of v, printLeaves(child)
</pre>

Let's translate that into Python:
<pre>
def printLeaves(v):
    if len(adjList[v][1]) == 0:
    	print v
	else:
	    for child in adjList[v][1]:
	        printLeaves(child)
</pre>

<p>Try running the program <a href="../amnh/adjTrees.py">adjTrees.py</a>.

<h4>Challenges</h4>

<ul>
	<li> Using the program as a template, write a function that returns the <b>number</b> of leaves beneath a vertex.  
	<li> Using the program as a template, write a function that returns the <b>height</b> of vertex (i.e. how many levels of the tree are above it, or the length of the path to the leave farthest away).
	<br>
	<i>Hint:  First think about what level a leave is at, and then what level a parent is, given the height of its children.</i>
</ul>
