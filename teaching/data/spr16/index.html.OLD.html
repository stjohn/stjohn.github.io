<ul>
	<li><b>What is data science? </b>
	
	<p>
	Data science uses techniques from computing, mathematics, and statistics to extract new insights from large data sets.  It is a very broad field but at its core is the use of automated techniques to analyze and make inferences from inputted data.  
	</p>
	
	<li><b>Who should take this course?</b>
	
	<p>
	This course is aimed at motivated students who want to apply the algorithms and mathematics they have learned to real data sets.  To do this, you should have a good understanding of representing 2 dimensional lists (that is, 
	multi-dimensional arrays and graph representations from a data structures course or matrices (from linear algebra)).
	</p>
	
	<li><b>What are the topics of the course?</b>
	
	<p>This course will focus on data acquisition (how do you take data from multiple sources and put it in usable forms), data storage, data mining and basic machine learning, and visualization.
	</p>
	
	<li><b>What are prerequisites? Does it matter that I have taken statistics?</b>
	
	<p>For the undergraduate sections, the prerequisites are linear algebra or data structures.  Further, a proficiency in the Python programming language is assumed.  The undergraduate sections will cover all the statistics needed.  
	
	<p>Those enrolled in the graduate level course are expected also to have completed undergraduate calculus-based statistics.  The graduate level assignments will assume fluency in undergraduate statistics, linear algebra, and multivariate calculus.
	

	<li><b>I haven't taken the prerequisites.  Can I still take the course?</b></li>	
	
	<p>
	No.  This is a fast paced, programming-intensive course.  You need to have solid knowledge of the prerequisites (linear algebra or data structures, and Python proficiency) to pass the course.  While it is often possible to circumvent the permissions system, please don't.  Doing so will not benefit you but will likely result in you doing poorly in all your courses while you struggle to keep up with one for which you are not prepared.  


	
	<li><b>Why Python and R?</b>
	
	<p>Python and R are the key languanges for data analytics, due to the ease in which they can manipulate files, matrices, perform statistical methods, and the added modules available for visualization.   
	Also, they are the key for the some of the
	<a href="http://mashable.com/2015/02/22/highest-paid-tech-jobs-2015/">
highest paid tech fields</a>: data analytics and machine learning.
	
	<li><b>I'm not that great at Python but want to take the course.  What should I do?</b>
	
	<p>
	Codecademy has a <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python">python tutorial</a> that is a great starting point.  You can also work through the exercises for <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/teaching/cmp/cmp230/s15/ps.html">introductory programming</a>:  a series of 50 short programming challenges that cover the basics for this course.

<h4><a name = "enrollment">Enrollment Questions</a></h4>

<ul>
	
	<li><b>How do I enroll?</b></li>
	
	<p>Enrollment is via the CUNYFirst system.  See the <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/registrar/">College Registrar</a> for more details.


	<li><b>I'm at CUNY but not Lehman.  Can I take this course?</b></li>
	
	<p>Yes.  Enrollment is via <a href="https://epermit.cuny.edu/permitdb/cunypermit.nsf/homepage">epermit.cuny.edu</a> using your portal credentials.  While colleges use a common system to request e-Permits, each department and each college has its own rules and preferences about allowing students to take a course at a different campus.  
	<!--You must apply via your home institution who may require you to take the equivalent course (albeit in another programming language) there.  Also, host institutions often give their students priority in enrollment over e-Permit students.  -->
	If you want to e-Permit a course, start the process early.


	<li><b>There are multiple sections of CMP 464 and MAT 456.  Which do I choose?</b></li>
	
	<p>CMP 464 and MAT 456 are numbers assigned to the topics courses in the department.  The topics change each semester, and there are often multiple sections offered at once.  The section numbers for Data Science are:
	<ul>
		<li> CMP 464-C401
		<li> MAT 456-01
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<li><b>The course is listed both as a CMP and MAT.  Is there a difference?  Which should I choose?</b></li>	
	
	<p>
	The lectures are the same, but the assignments are different for the computer science and mathematics versions of the course.  Both sections have analytic reasoning (including programming and proofs) about large data sets. The computer science section requires more programming;  the mathematics section requires more proofs.  
	
	
	<li><b>The course is also listed as a graduate course. Is there a difference?  Which should I choose?</b></li>	
	
	<p>
	The lectures are the same, but the assignments are different for the undergraduate and graduate versions.  The graduate version of the course has significantly more work, assumes knowledge of undergraduate statistics, and expects a much higher level of sophistication in the programming and projects submitted.
	
	

	
	<li><b>This course does not show up on my Blackboard account.  Why?</b></li>
	
	<p>
	It takes about 24 hours from time of registration for you to be added to a course roster on Blackboard.  If it has been more than a day and the course does not appear, check your course list in your CUNYFirst account to make sure that your registration has been processes and you are officially enrolled.  If you are enrolled, contact <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/itr/blackboard.php">Blackboard Support</a> in the Information Technology Division. 

	<li><b>I can't get on to my Blackboard account.  How do I fix it?</b></li>
	
	 <p>
	 If you are enrolled, contact <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/itr/blackboard.php">Blackboard Support</a> in the Information Technology Division.  You can also visit the Help Desk in the Computer Center (first floor, Carman Hall) in person.  They can reset passwords and help with simple Blackboard issues.

<h4><a name = "expectations">Expectations</a></h4>

<ul>
	
	<li><b>Do I need to attend class?</b></li>
	
	<p>Yes.  Attending class in an integral part of the learning process.  Further, in-class quizzes are offered every class and make up a significant part of your final grade.
	
	<li><b>How many hours a week does this class take?</b></li>
	
	<p>Most students spend 6-12 hours a week outside of class hours.  Federal guidelines state that 12 credit hours is considered full time enrollment.
	Given a nominal 40 hour work week, this translates to an expected (40-12)/12 = 2 to 3 hours a week per credit hour of outside class time.  As a 4 credit course, your expected time is about 8 to 12 hours of out-of-class work per week.

<!--	
	<p>A way to manage the time commitment is to set aside a daily period of time to work on this course.  Like learning a foreign language, learning a programming language is easier (and takes less work) if you work on it in smaller pieces on a regular basis.  Set aside an hour a day for this course.  During that hour, complete the upcoming programming assignment and review your course notes and recent labs to prepare for the in-class quizzes.  If you finish that early, go on to the next program.  We encourage students to work ahead on the programs!

	
	<li><b>Do I need to use Blackboard?</b></li>
	
	<p>
	Yes.  We use Blackboard almost every class, and you will need regular access to submit the 50 programming assignments, view your grades, access information about the final exam, and receive announcements for the class.
	
	<li><b>Do you accept late homework?</b></li>
	
	<p>
	No.  Programming assignments must be submitted by the 11:59pm on the day due.  To allow for emergencies that arise over the semester, we drop the lowest 3 grades from the Programming total.

<h4><a name = "resources">Resources</a></h4>

<ul>

<!--
	<li><b>What is the textbook?  Do I have to buy the textbook?</b></li>


	<p>The book is required for the course, and you may use the book during in-class Blackboard quizzes (but you may not share someone else's book during the quiz).
-->
	<li><b>How do I get Python for my computer?</b></li>


	<p>Python is freely available from <a href="http://python.org">python.org</a>.  
	
	<!--For this course, we use Python 2 (any stable version).  Note that there are large changes between Python 2 and Python 3.  We are using Python and previous versions, so, if your computer has Python 2.7 (included as the default in the MacIntosh OS X operating system), you will also need to add Python 3.
	-->

	<li><b>If I don't have a computer at home, do I still have to do the programming assignments?</b></li>
	
	<p>Yes.  If you do not have a computer at home, there are computers available on-campus with Python.
	
	<p>You can also use on-line resources such as <a href="http://datajoy.com">datajoy.com</a>.
	
	<li><b>Where are computers with Python available on campus?</b></li>
	
	<p>Python 3 is available on computers in:
		<ul>
			<li> Department Learning Center in Gillet 222
			<li> Computer Center in Carman Hall (computers near windows, or ask staff if unsure)
			<li> Most computers in the public areas of the Library
		</ul>

<h4><a name = "grading">Grading Questions</a></h4>

<ul>

	
<!--
	<li><b>What is my grade in the class?</b></li>
	
	<p>
	On Blackboard, the column "Current Grade" gives a running total of your grade for the course.  It includes all programming assignments and in-class quizzes that have been graded to date.  
	</p>
-->

	<li><b>I like working by myself.  Why do I have to work in pairs or groups?</b></li>
	<p>
	
	Active learning <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410.full">increases student performance</a>.  Instead of passively listening or watching someone else write or type programs, it is much more effective to have active discussions, work together in pairs or small groups, and other activities that emphasize higher-order learning.  It also provides an excellent avenue to practice explaining technical ideas to others-- a skill you will need for future STEM courses and future jobs in technical fields.	

	<li><b>Do I have to take the final examination?</b></li>
	 
	<p>Yes.  All undergraduate courses at Lehman College are required to have final examinations offered during finals week.  
	
	<li><b>Why do I have to pass the final to pass the class?</b></li>
	
	<p>The final examination is cumulative and passing it shows that you have mastered all of the learning objectives of the course.
	
	<li><b>But this is a programming class, why can't the final be on-line?</b></li>
	
	<p>An essential component to programming and technical work is presenting and communicating ideas concisely to others (without the use of a search engine or the Python shell).  The communicating of technical information is so important to many companies that they include a paper or oral quiz (no computer allowed) on key concepts during the interview.  Companies hire you for your analytic reasoning and programming skills, not your ability to google answers (since they want employees who can also solve novel problems whose solutions aren't already available via a search engine).
	Some go beyond just key concepts and ask for you to sketch solutions for novel questions and situations during the interview (the most famous is the Google engineering interview).  
<!--	
	<p>
	While having a combination of oral and written examinations would be a better preparation for communicating technical information (and better for future jobs and job interviews), many beginning students find oral exams terrifying.  As such, we focus just on written exams and include (ungraded) group work in class to provide practice in presenting ideas to others.  In future courses, class presentations are incorporated to help with fluency in communicating challenging material.
	</p>
-->
	
	<li><b>When is the final?</b></li>
	
	<p>	
	The final examination times for all courses are announced by the <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/registrar/calendars.php">Registrar's Office</a>.
	This class has been assigned:
	<ul>
		<li>Thursday, 26 May 2016, 11am to 1pm.
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<li><b>I'm a really good student in my other classes.  Because of that, can't you give me a higher grade?</b></li>
	
	<p>
	No.  We are happy that you are doing well in your other courses, but we are required to treat all students equally and base your grade on the work submitted for this course.  
	</p>
</ul>


</div>



	
	

	
<!--	
	<li><b>Why do you post running totals?</b></li>
	<p>
	Find results that show lack of feedback is detrimental to non-traditional groups in the field, especially women.
