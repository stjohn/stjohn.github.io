<h3>Textbook's Code</h3>
<p>
For this assignment, the following code from the textbook will be useful:

<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch/blob/master/code/clustering.py">clustering.py</a>
</ul>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Data</h3>


<p>For this assignment, you will need to download the following data sets:
<ol>
	<li> <b>CUNY Locations</b>:  the locations of the campuses of the City University of New York on a satelitte image of the city: 
	<blockquote><a href="https://data.ny.gov/Education/City-University-of-New-York-CUNY-University-Campus/i5b5-imzn">https://data.ny.gov/Education/City-University-of-New-York-CUNY-University-Campus/i5b5-imzn</a> 
	</blockquote>   
</ol>

<p>
We will use these data sets for later homework assignments.  Since scraping the data takes time, save these data sets to use again for the future programs.

<td colspan=2>
Using the functions from the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.17.0/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Voronoi.html">scipy Voronoi module</a>, create a Voronoi diagram of the CUNY campus locations.  
<br><br>  
Make sure to include in the title in your plot. <br>
#1:  Submit your Python program as a <b>.py</b> file.<br>
#2:  Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.<br>

<th>#3-4</th>
<td colspan=2>
In class, we wrote the function
<pre>
	computeNearestNeighbor(fixedPoints, newPoint)
</pre>
where <tt>fixedPoints</tt> is a list of points and <tt>newPoint</tt> is a new point,
and the function returns the point from the list <tt>fixedPoints</tt> that is closest
to <tt>newPoint</tt>. 
Use this function to shade an image based on distance to the nearest point in a list.  

<p>
Your program should: 
<ol>
	<li> Create an array to hold an image of 400 by 400 pixels.
	<li> Ask the user for a list of points.
	<li> Assign a (random) color to each fixed point (a dictionary would work well here).
	<li> For each 0<= i,j < 400:
	<li>  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Compute the closest fixedPoint, <tt>fp</tt> to the point (i,j)
	<li>   &nbsp;&nbsp; Shade the point (i,j) by the color assigned to <tt>fp</tt>
	<li> Display the image created.
	<li> Save the image to a file.
</ol>

Make sure to include in the title in your plot. <br>
#3:  Submit your Python program as a <b>.py</b> file.<br>
#4:  Submit <b>.png</b> file that contains your image generated by a run of your program on the points: (100,100), (200,350), (5,395), (375,25), and (200,100). <br>
Note your plot might look upside down since on images, (0,0) is the upper left corner.

<tr><th>#5-7</th>
<td colspan=2>
Use the book's <tt>clustering.py</tt> program to produce images of 
<a href="gillet.png">Gillet Hall</a> with 5 colors.  Modify his program to compute the sum squared error of your clustering to 5 colors (i.e. the sum of the squares of the distance between each point's original color and the color assigned to it).
<br>
<br>  
Make sure to include in the title in your plot. <br><br>
#5:  Submit your modified Python program as a <b>.py</b> file.<br>
#6:  Submit the <tt>.png</tt> file of the image with 5 colors.<br>
#7:  Include a screen shot or text file with the summed square error that you computed for the images.<br><br>
Hint:  The k-means clustering is slow, so, it will take a while to compute the new images.  The book's program includes a method for computing the squared error that reruns the classifer (which takes quite a while).  Instead of recomputing, store your clusters and compute the error directly on those.

<h3>Submitting Homework</h3>

To submit your homework, log on to the Blackboard system, and go to "Homework".  For each part of the homework, there is a separate input box.  You may submit the homework as many times as you would like before the deadline.
