<h2>Quizzes</h2>
</a>
Unless otherwise noted, quizzes are available on Blackboard for the 24 hours after lecture.  Blackboard access is generated automatically from the registrar.  See the ICIT <a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/it/blackboard/student-documentation-and-support-for-blackboard">Blackboard</a> page for resources and tutorials for using the system.
There are no make-up quizzes. Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).  See the <a href="syl.html">syllabus</a> for additional information on how grades are calculated.

  <blockquote>
  <i>
  Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.</i>

<h2>Homework</h2>
</a>
Unless otherwise noted, programs are submitted on the course's gradescope site.  All students registered by Monday, 23 August will be sent a registration invitation to the email on record on their Blackboard account.  If you did not receive the email or would like to use a different account, contact us with your name (as it appears in Blackboard/CUNYFirst), your EmpID, and the preferred email, and we will manually generate an invitation.  As a default, we use your name as it appears in Blackboard/CUNYFirst (to update CUNYFirst, see <a href="https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/changing-your-personal-information/">changing your personal information</a>).  If you prefer a different name for Gradescope, include it in the email and we will update the Gradescope registration.

<p>
To get full credit for a program, the file must include in the opening comment:
<ul>
    <li> Your name, as it appears in your Gradescope registration.
    <li> The email you are using for Gradescope.
    <li> A list of any resources you used for the program.  Include classmates and tutors that you worked with, along with any websites or tutorials that you used.  If you used no resources (other than the class notes and textbooks), then you should include the line:  "No resources used."
</ul>

For example, for the student, Thomas Hunter, the opening comment of his first program might be:
<div style="background-color:lightgray;width:100%">
<pre>
"""
Name:  Thomas Hunter
Email: thomas.hunter.1870@hunter.cuny.edu
Resources:  Used python.org as a reminder of Python 3 print statements.
"""
</pre>
</div>
and then followed by his Python program.

<br>
<br>
<hr>
Set 1:  The first set of programs recaps familiar Python constructs and packages.  None are challenging, instead, their purpose is as review and to ensure your Python IDE is functional, has the basic libraries and that you can submit programs to Gradescope.
<hr>

<p><a name="p1"><b>Program 1</b></a> <i>(Due noon, Friday, 27 August):</i>  Submit a Python program that prints:  <tt>Hello, world!</tt>

<p><a name="p2"><b>Program 2</b></a> <i>(Due noon, Monday, 30 August):</i>
Write a program, using the <tt>pandas</tt> package, that asks the user for the name of an input CSV file and the name of an output CSV file.  The program should open the file name provided by the user.  Next, the program should select rows where the field <tt>senate_class</tt> is non-empty and write the <tt>first_name</tt> and <tt>last_name</tt> to a file with the output file name provided by the user.

<p>For example, if the file was <a href="https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.csv">legislators-current.csv</a> with the first 3 lines of:

<div style="background-color:lightgray;width:100%">

</pre>

Then a sample run of the program:
<div style="background-color:lightgray;width:100%">
<pre>
Enter input file name: legislators-current.csv
Enter output file name:  senatorNames.csv
</pre>
</div>

And the first three lines of <tt>senatorNames.csv</tt> would be:
<div style="background-color:lightgray;width:100%">
<pre>
first_name,last_name
Sherrod,Brown
Maria,Cantwell
</pre>
</div>
Note:  if you use the legislators CSV above, your output file should have 101 lines:  1 line of header information and 100 rows of data.

<p><a name="p3"><b>Program 3</b></a> <i>(Due noon, Wednesday, 1 September):</i>
Write a program that asks the user for the name of an input CSV file and the name of an output CSV file.  The program should open the file name provided by the user.  Next, the program should select rows where the field <tt>senate_class</tt> is non-empty and write the <tt>first_name</tt> and compute the <tt>age</tt> based on the <tt>birthday</tt> field as of the first of the year.  Your program should write out a new CSV file (with the name provided by the user) with the two columns:  <tt>first_name</tt> and <tt>age</tt>.

<p>For example, if the file was <a href="https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.csv">legislators-current.csv</a> with the first 3 lines of:

<div style="background-color:lightgray;width:100%">

And the first three lines of <tt>senatorAge.csv</tt> would be:
<div style="background-color:lightgray;width:100%">
<pre>
first_name,age
Sherrod,68
Maria,62
</pre>
</div>
since that was their ages as of January 1, 2021.
<p>
Note:  if you use the legislators CSV above, your output file should have 101 lines:  1 line of header information and 100 rows of data.


<!--
<p><a name="p4"><b>Program 4</b></a> <i>(Due noon, Thursday, 2 September):</i>  Finish up the class exercise and compute the error on age prediction, using the ages computed from Program 3 and the textbook's estimates.  Some names do not appear in the SSN name data (such as "Sherrod"), since it only keeps track of the top 1000 names for any given year.  Keep track of the number of names you cannot predict so that when you compute the average error, you only divide through by the number for which you can comptue the value.

<p><a name="p5"><b>Program 5</b></a> <i>(Due noon, Friday, 3 September):</i>
Write a program, tailored to the NYC OpenData Yellow Taxi Trip Data, that asks the user for the name of an input CSV file and the name of an output CSV file.  The program should open the file name provided by the user.  Next, the program should copy the input file and create two new columns:  <tt>percent_tip</tt>, which is <tt>100*tip_amount/fare_amount</tt> and <tt>percent_fare</tt>, which is <tt>100*fare_amount/total_amount</tt>.  Your program should write out a new CSV file (with the name provided by the user) with the original columns as well as the two newly computed ones.

<p>For example, if the file was the first 10 days in January 2019 entries downloaded from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2019-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/2upf-qytp">2019 Yellow Taxi Trip Data</a> (about 2.2 million entries) with the first 3 lines of:

<p> You should round the values stored in your new columns to the nearest tenth.




P5:

Add in a data cleaning applying to data frames-- very easy, but make sure all can do this before assuming this is a basic step in larger programs.  Code demo of 9 Sept, so, have 2 programs after that.

Wait on the background for the Obama v. Romney, and instead have a several data cleaning example just using string methods.  One that needs to check for empty entries.  Another that combines multiple columns into a new one.  maybe the 311 or NYPD data (since often missing GIS coordinates).

To lead into lecture #3:  sample vs. census of a large data set-- book uses Obama vs. Romney.  Add in a question about cluster and stratified sampling?  Wait until random packages discussed?  Or just use the basic Python one?

<br>
<hr>
Set 2:  The second set of programs focuses on incorporating and analyzing rectangular data, in terms of relational databases and data frames.  The goal is familiarity with these canonical representations to use as building blocks for future analysis, programs, and your project.
<hr>

<br>
<hr>
Set 3:  The third set of programs integrates visualization techniques with analyzing structured data sets.  While the programs do not cover every visualization technique, the practice these programs provide will be directly relevant to your project.
<hr>

Include in each data set a prediction question (building on tools known at the time)-- focus on NYC data, leading up to more open-ended (aka Kaggle-style) one in November/December

Submit a .txt file that contains the standard heading information from above and the last line of the file contains the login name of the github account you plan to use this term.
