<h2>Quizzes</h2>
</a>
Unless otherwise noted, quizzes are available on Blackboard for the 24 hours after lecture.  Blackboard access is generated automatically from the registrar.  See the ICIT <a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/it/blackboard/student-documentation-and-support-for-blackboard">Blackboard</a> page for resources and tutorials for using the system.
There are no make-up quizzes. Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).

<h2>Homework</h2>
</a>
Unless otherwise noted, programs are submitted on the course's gradescope site.  All students registered by Monday, 23 August will be sent a registration invitation to the email on record on their Blackboard account.  If you did not receive the email or would like to use a different account, contact us with your name (as it appears in Blackboard/CUNYFirst), your EmpID, and the preferred email, and we will manually generate an invitation.  As a default, we use your name as it appears in Blackboard/CUNYFirst (to update CUNYFirst, see <a href="https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/changing-your-personal-information/">changing your personal information</a>).  If you prefer a different name for Gradescope, include it in the email and we will update the Gradescope registration.

<p>
To get full credit for a program, the file must include in the opening comment:
<ul>
    <li> Your name, as it appears in your Gradescope registration.
    <li> The email you are using for Gradescope.
    <li> A list of any resources you used for the program.  Include classmates and tutors that you worked with, along with any websites or tutorials that you used.  If you used no resources (other than the class notes and textbooks), then you should include the line:  "No resources used."
</ul>

For example, for the student, Thomas Hunter, the opening comment of his first program might be:
<div style="background-color:lightgray;width:100%">
<pre>
"""
Name:  Thomas Hunter
Email: thomas.hunter.1870@hunter.cuny.edu
Resources:  Used python.org as a reminder of Python 3 print statements.
"""
</pre>
</div>
and then followed by his Python program.

<br>
<br>
<hr>
Set 1:  The first set of programs recaps familiar Python constructs and packages.  None are challenging, instead, their purpose is as review and to ensure your Python IDE is functional, has the basic libraries and that you can submit programs to Gradescope.
<hr>

<p><a name="p1"><b>Program 1</b></a> <i>(Due noon, Friday, 27 August):</i>  Submit a Python program that prints:  <tt>Hello, world!</tt>

<p><a name="p4"><b>Program 4</b></a> <i>(Due noon, Thursday, 2 September):</i>
  Write a program that asks the user for the name of an input CSV file and the name of an output CSV file.  The program should open the file name provided by the user.  Next, the program should select rows where the field <tt>Grade</tt> is equal to 3 and the <tt>Year</tt> is equal to 2019 and write all rows that match that criteria to a new CSV file.

  <p>For example, if the file was <tt>school-ela-results-2013-2019.csv</tt> (extracted from <a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/test-results">NYC Schools Test Results</a>) with the first lines of the output file would be:

<p><a name="p5"><b>Program 5</b></a> <i>(Due noon, Friday, 3 September):</i>
  Write a program that asks the user for the name of an input CSV file and the name of an output CSV file.  The program should open the file name provided by the user.  Your program should include a function, <tt>extractDistrict()</tt> that takes a string as an input and returns the number represented by the first two characters in the string.  The program applies the function to each row that takes the first two characters of the <tt>School</tt> field, converts those into a digit, and stores the results in a new column, <tt>District</tt>.
  The results should be written to a new CSV file, name provided by the user.

  <p> For example, if the <tt>School</tt> is <tt>"01M015"</tt>, the entry in the new column would be <tt>1</tt> (stored as a number, not a string).

  Finish up the class exercise and compute the error on age prediction, using the ages computed from Program 3 and the textbook's estimates.  Some names do not appear in the SSN name data (such as "Sherrod"), since it only keeps track of the top 1000 names for any given year.  Keep track of the number of names you cannot predict so that when you compute the average error, you only divide through by the number for which you can comptue the value.


Write a program, tailored to the NYC OpenData Yellow Taxi Trip Data, that asks the user for the name of an input CSV file and the name of an output CSV file.  The program should open the file name provided by the user.  Next, the program should copy the input file and create two new columns:  <tt>percent_tip</tt>, which is <tt>100*tip_amount/fare_amount</tt> and <tt>percent_fare</tt>, which is <tt>100*fare_amount/total_amount</tt>.  Your program should write out a new CSV file (with the name provided by the user) with the original columns as well as the two newly computed ones.

<p>For example, if the file was the first 10 days in January 2019 entries downloaded from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2019-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/2upf-qytp">2019 Yellow Taxi Trip Data</a> (about 2.2 million entries) with the first 3 lines of:

Add in a data cleaning applying to data frames-- very easy, but make sure all can do this before assuming this is a basic step in larger programs.  Code demo of 9 Sept, so, have 2 programs after that.

Wait on the background for the Obama v. Romney, and instead have a several data cleaning example just using string methods.  One that needs to check for empty entries.  Another that combines multiple columns into a new one.  maybe the 311 or NYPD data (since often missing GIS coordinates).

To lead into lecture #3:  sample vs. census of a large data set-- book uses Obama vs. Romney.  Add in a question about cluster and stratified sampling?  Wait until random packages discussed?  Or just use the basic Python one?

Need several questions on correlation-- maybe set 3 or 4?
From Lehman's DS course:  HW5:  Are collisions correlated with temperature?

Regex questions:  different spellings of same name in baby name SSN data (HW 5 from Lehman)

A/B Testing-- do as part of quizzes when we do Bayes Theorem

Image processing:  a bit too simple, but something like:  HW 7
The USGS collected images before and after the Both: New Year's flooding: New Year's flooding (saved as png for December, 2015 and for January, 2016). Write a program that produces an image with flooded regions marked in red (that is, any pixel that is not "blue" in 2015 but is in the 2016 image).

GIS Data:  HW 8:

Plot the locations of the campuses of the City University of New York on a satelitte image of the city. Make sure to include in the title of your plot the date plotted.

#1: Submit your Python program as a .py file.
#2: Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.

Hint: Use the drawcounties() option in basemap and show only the region including New York City. Use the csv module to extract the latitude and longitude from the downloaded NYC data file.

Make a plot that includes all the WiFi locations within one hundredth of a degree of a location of your choice. For example, Lehman College is at 40.8725 degrees North and 73.8939 degrees West. For this location, you would include all hotspots that within 0.01 in either direction (since the plot will be square). Your plot should color the inside hotspots blue and the outside hotspots green (GIS location as well as type available in the CSV file of hotspots). Make sure to include in your title of the plot the region of the city you are plotting.

#5: Submit your Python program as a .py file.
#6: Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.

#3: Submit your Python program as a .py file.
#4: Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.

Write a classifer program that predicts if a name is boy or girl's name based on the last letters of the name.
#2: Write a Python program that takes as input a Social Security Administration name file (see above for files and format) and outputs three files. The first file should have 26 lines (one for each letter of the alphabet). Each line contains three values: the letter, the fraction of boys' names ends in that letter in the training set (inputted file), the fraction of girls' names that in that letter in the training set. For example: a possible file could start:
a, 0.023, 0.451
b, 0.010, 0.008
...
The second file computes the fraction of boys and girls names that has the second to last letter specified.
The third file computes the fraction of boys and girls names that has the third to last letter specified.
#2: Submit your Python program that computes correlation and produces the graph as a .py file.

#3: Run your program with yob2009.txt and submit the first file generated by your program (that is, the fractions for the last letter of the name). Submit your file as a .txt file.

#4: Run your program with yob2009.txt and submit the first file generated by your program (that is, the fractions for the last letter of the name). Submit your file as a .txt file.

#5: Run your program with yob2009.txt and submit the first file generated by your program (that is, the fractions for the last letter of the name). Submit your file as a .txt file.

#6: Modify the Naive Bayes spam filter program to reads in the three files generated above as well as a fourth file of test data (use another year's data such as yob2010.txt). Instead of multiplying together word occurrences, your program should multiply use the last letter, second-to-last letter, and third-to-last letter that you computed above. Your program should classify each name in the test data (similar to the Naive Bayes filter from the book) and report back the percentage of names your correctly predicted as well as the names you predicted incorrectly.
Submit your Python program as a .py file.

#7: Submit the output of your file (the percentage you correctly predicted along with the names you predicted incorrectly) as a .txt file.

Covariance:  HW 9:  Analyse the NY Fed's Labor Market Data for Recent Graduates (see link above) using a Principal Components Analysis. There are three parts to this exercise:
Compute and display the covariance matrix for the data,
Generate a 3D plot of the data under the first three axis of a Principal Components Analysis. On this plot, highlight (using a different color) the computer science and mathematics majors, and
Include the Python code that you used to generate your plots.
Make sure to include in the title of your plot the date plotted.

#1: Submit your Python program as a .py file.
#2: Submit a text file or screen shot that includes the covariance matrix.
#3: Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.

Using the New York City data for district test scores, shade your map above by percentage of students proficient in mathematics (i.e. scored a 3 or 4 on the exam-- the last column in the CSV file).

#6: Submit your Python program as a .py file.
#7: Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.

#6: Using the New York City data for district test scores, compute the covariance matrix for District 1 schools across grades (that is, rows 8 to 28, columns G onward). Which rows are most highly correlated? Submit a typeset or neatly handwritten image of your answer.

#7: Compute the first and second axis of a Principal Components Analysis using the covariance matrix above. Submit a typeset or neatly handwritten image of your answer.

When do mapping, something with litter baskets:  https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/DSNY-Litter-Basket-Map-/d6m8-cwh9

Need some programs on displaying, time-series data, something like the standard stocks example.  Here's bokeh: https://docs.bokeh.org/en/0.10.0/docs/gallery/stocks.html
Find on altair

HW 12:  The file landmarkDistances.txt contains a distance matrix for 10 landmarks in New York City. The file landmarks.txt contains the names of 9 of the landmarks. The last name is "mystery". Use multidimensional scaling to display all 10 points on the screen with landmarks labeled. Using your displayed information, identify the last mystery landmark.
(Based on the inspired homework from dasGupta's machine learning course at UCSD.)

Make sure to include in the title of your plot the date plotted.

#1: Submit your Python program as a .py file.
#2: Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.
#3: Does the plot look right? If not, how can you re-orient so that it does? What is the mystery landmark? Include your answer in a .txt or a scan of a neatly handwritten paper.


HW 12:  Using the 311 Pothole data (described above), use logistic regression analysis of time versus status: "Closed" versus "Open" (any non-"Closed" values of the status include in the "Open" category) to create a model that predicts if a pothole has been repaired, given the date reported.
You may want to use the textbook's code (described above)-- if you do, modify to take only 1 input parameter (instead of the 2 it currently takes). This is a very small change (just change the starting beta_0 to match the dimension of the data and be [1,1].)

#4: Submit your Python program as a .py file.
#5: Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing a plot of the data points (a scatterplot of (date,status) where status is 0 if closed and 1 otherwise) with the logistic curve that you fit to the data.


HW 12:  Using bokeh, display the unemployment data (described above) as a scatter plot of the data with a 6-month running average.
Note: The bokeh part is straightforward (very similar to the stock example-- you need to modify the #prepare some data section (as well as titles and labels)). The work here is setting up your data to be plotted. The dates need to be datetime objects for the stretching and scaling of the x-axis to work.

Make sure to include a title in your plot.

#6: Submit your Python program as a .py file.
#7: Submit a screen shot of your program as an .png or .jpg file. (This homework originally asked for the .html file, but Blackboard is stripping the HTML formatting out of submitted files.)


HW 12:  Modeling question-- not sure when to integrate into topics:
Given the data:
x	0	1	2	4	5	7	8	9	12	15
y	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1

and two possible logistic functions:

f(x) = 1/(1 +e^{-(6+.75x)})
g(x) = 1/(1 +e^{-(-8+x)})
#6: Which function predicts more of the data correctly? That is, out of the 10 input values, how many values were predicted to be 1 with greater than 50% probability were actually 1 (true positives), were actually 0 (false positives); how many values were predicted to be 0 with greater than 50% probability were actually 0 (true negatives), were actually 1 (false negatives)?

Submit a typeset or neatly handwritten answer.


#7: Use the book's logistic regression code to fit a logistic function to the data above.
Note: The book's code assumes that 3 dimensional data while we have only 2 dimensions. The code is well-written and can be easily modified to handle only 2 dimensions by entering 2 dimensional data for data and modifying the starting value of beta_0 to be the [1,1].

Submit a screenshot of a graph with the true points, your predicted curve (i.e. the logistic function with your computed beta_hat, and the f and g functions above. Include a legend or labels for your curves.
