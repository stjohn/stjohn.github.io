In addition to traditional office hours, there are:
<ul>
	<li> <b>Problem Solving & Whiteboarding:</b>  Most Wednesdays, 9:30-11am: 1001-E HN:  These are themed office hours, open to all students who wish to practice problem solving (found in programming & algorithms courses and technical interviews).  
	<li>These meet in the 1001E lab and will <b>start 11 September</b> when the lab has been rearranged from orientation format to code review format.  <li>Since it's in the 1001E lab, no food is allowed, but you may have drinks in closed containers.   </li>
	<li> All those who attend will be expected to work in pairs or small groups during the session.
	<li> We will be using problems from <a href="https://leetcode.com">leet code</a> (free, but registration required) and <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>.
</ul>

See <a href="techInterview.html">the schedule of sessions</a> for more details.
