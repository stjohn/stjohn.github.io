<p>I regularly mentor both undergraduate and graduate students (and
occasionally high school students) for research projects.
See my
<a href="index.html">research page</a> for recent research grants
and publications.

<!--
<p>Megan Owen and I run an academic year
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/treespaceworkinggroup/reu-program">Research Experience for Undergraduates</a> program, funded by the
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a>.  The program supports
a cohort of 10 undergraduate students towards the beginning of their academic career.
Applications are in the late spring and the program runs Fridays in the fall, and an
intensive January session.
-->

<h3>Prospective Doctoral Students</h3>

Admissions to the doctoral program are handled centrally by the Graduate Center,
and you should contact them directly.  While I would be happy to discuss the
merits of the programs there, the admissions committee makes all decisions.



<h3>Prospective Undergraduate and Masters Students</h3>

<p>
Almost all of my research is collaborative and is approachable by
students with strong analytical skills.  The projects require the
ability to program well, strong proof skills, or a strong background
in phylogenetics.  In addition, students work in teams of two or
three and must have good written and oral communication skills.
Students with the following are most likely to succeed:
<ul>
	<li> A GPA of 3.5 or higher,
	<li> At least a grade of B in all Biology, Computer Science,
	English, and Mathmatics courses taken,
	<li> Completion of third term programming (know standard graph
	algorithms well),<br> or completion of a proof-based mathematics
	course (analysis or algebra),<br> or completion of a junior-level
	phylogenetics or systematics course.
</ul>


Expectations:
<ul>
	<li> Spend at least 5 hours a week working on the project,
	<li> Attend weekly meetings with your teammates and with me,
	<li> Write up regular progress reports (including well-documented
		code and/or proofs),
	<li> Prepare and present your work at poster sessions (usually
		once a semester),
	<li> Sharing your programs and notes with others, and
	<li> Be involved in writing and editing final work for publication.
</ul>


Funding is available for 5-10 hours a week via grant funding and
via the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation in Research (LSAMP)
for those who qualify.
