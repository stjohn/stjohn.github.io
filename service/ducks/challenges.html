Hunter College<br>
January 2020</h2>
</div>


<div>
The challenges below are part of the DuckieTown@Hunter workshop in January 2020.
The four-day, hands-on workshop introduces challenges in autonomous navigation with Duckietown. <a href="http://duckietown.org">Duckietown</a> is a colorful, realistic, internationally used platform that makes research issues in autonomous driving accessible. This workshop was made possible by a <a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/2019_explorecsr_grantees.pdf">Google Award for Undergraduate Computer Science Research Focused Workshops for Women</a>.

<h2>Getting Started: Calibrations & Test Runs</h2>
<hr>

<p><b>Goal:</b> To drive a calibrated robot through both towns, using the joystick program.
<p><b>Equipment needed:</b>  Department linux laptop and duckieBot.

<hr>
<h3>Setting Up Your Laptop</h3>

<p>
Check out a laptop, log in-- password is on whiteboard. 

<p>
Make sure you are on the wifi, <tt>duckieworkshop</tt>; the password is on the  whiteboard.  The duckiebots are connected to that wifi.

<p>
Open up two terminal windows.   
Opening a duckietown shell (dts) on the linux laptop (note: use terminal + chrome browser),

<h3>Setting Up DuckieBots</h3>

<p>Check out a duckieBot, ping the duckieBot, monitor the containers loaded, 
<ul>
	<li> Remember to remove the lens cap off and put in box.
	<li> Plug in the battery.
	<li> Double click the side button if it doesn't automatically already turns on.
</ul>	
	

<p>

<h3>Calibrating Cameras</h3>
Calibrating cameras (using dts commands)...

<h3>Calibrating Wheels</h3>

<h3>Driving with Joystick</h3>

Launching app, use the camera dts, launching joystick, need to use the arrow keys.


<hr>
<h3>Extra Challenges</h3>

<ul>
	<li><b>What does the camera see?</b>  what does the camera see?  Launch the video debug feed.  Taking a photo (can this be done just from dts, or do we need to load a program?)

<h2>Development Pipeline:  Using Git, Docker, Containers, and Python</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>Goal:</b> Create a program, package it into a container, load on your bot, and run the program.
<p><b>Equipment needed:</b>  Department linux laptop and duckieBot.
<hr>

<h3>Overview of Software Architecture</h3>


First duckieTown programs:
Basics of programs in duckieTown:  software architecture (extra layers of containers & downloading to robots),  using git to pull down repos, set-up, how to edit, building and installing on robots (2 high-level slides (5 minutes) and then work through Jacopo’s intro (45 minutes)
Hello World: Run a program via the docker that says: Hello World (Unit C-5, Section 5.5, https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/opmanual_duckiebot/out.pdf) https://github.com/duckietown/rpi-duckiebot-simple-python/blob/master18/hello.py  Better description in Jacopo’s class notes: https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/duckietown-robotics-development/out/python_programs_environments.html
Work through:  https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/software_devel/out/ros_commands.html
First duckieTown program:  go straight for 60 centimeters (one square) and stop.
Modify to include turns:  make at least 4 turns and return to the same spot.
Write out the commands to travel the entire track (only using turning, no camera capture).
