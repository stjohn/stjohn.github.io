<h2>DuckieTown Workshop<br>
Hunter College<br>
January 2020</h2>
</div>


<div>
The challenges below are part of the DuckieTown@Hunter workshop in January 2020.
The four-day, hands-on workshop introduces challenges in autonomous navigation with Duckietown. <a href="http://duckietown.org">Duckietown</a> is a colorful, realistic, internationally used platform that makes research issues in autonomous driving accessible. This workshop was made possible by a <a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/2019_explorecsr_grantees.pdf">Google Award for Undergraduate Computer Science Research Focused Workshops for Women</a>.

<h2>Getting Started: Calibrations & Test Runs</h2>
<hr>

<p><b>Goal:</b> To drive a calibrated robot through both towns, using the joystick program.
<p><b>Equipment needed:</b>  Department linux laptop and duckieBot.

<hr>
<h3>Setting Up Your Laptop & DuckieTown Account</h3>

<p>
Check out a laptop, log in-- password is on whiteboard. 

<p>We have the software loaded, so, we're skipping ahead in the Duckiebot assembly and setup.
<p>Go to the documennation  page  for creating a  duckieTown account:

<blockquote>
<tt>
https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/opmanual_duckiebot/out/dt_account.html
</tt>
</blockquote>
Our regional community is New York.  Make sure to include your institution as Hunter College.   
Having an account allows you to create tokens to use the dashboard (next section).  You can copy the token by highlighting it and then clicking CTRL-Shift-C (and pasting by CTRL-Shift-V).

To set up your token:
<blockquote>
<tt>
dts tok set
</tt>
</blockquote>


<p>You can check to see that authentication worked, by typing at the terminal:
<blockquote>
<tt>
dts challenges info
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Make sure you are on the wifi, <tt>duckieworkshop</tt>; the password is on the  whiteboard.  The duckiebots are connected to that wifi.


<p>
Open up two terminal windows.   
Opening a duckietown shell (dts) on the linux laptop (note: use terminal + chrome browser),

<h3>Setting Up DuckieBots</h3>

<p>Check out a duckieBot, ping the duckieBot, monitor the containers loaded, 
<ul>
	<li> Remember to remove the lens cap off and put in box.
	<li> Plug in the battery.
	<li> Double click the side button if it doesn't automatically already turns on.
</ul>	
	
<p>Check to see the robot is turned on and on the wifi:
<blockquote>
<tt>
ping hunterbotXX.local
</tt>
</blockquote>
where XX is the number of your bot.   To stop the messages, type CTRL-C.

<p>
To launch the dashboard, open up Chrome (Firefox will work but flicker a bit):
<ul>
	<li> Click on + key to open a new tab.
	<li> At the navigation bar, type:  hunterbotXX.local
	<li> You will be prompted for your token, cut-and-paste it into the text-area.
	<li> Click on the <tt>Mission Control</tt> tab.   Open the default mission.
</ul>
You should see several graphs and the camera output, but we need to load more onto the bot to be able to move.

<h3>Calibrating Cameras</h3>
Calibrating cameras (using dts commands)...

<h3>Calibrating Wheels</h3>
Calibrating wheels (using dts commands)...

<h3>Driving with Joystick</h3>

Launching app, use the camera dts, launching joystick, need to use the arrow keys.

<p>
When you're done with your robot, gently disconnect the battery cables.


<hr>
<h3>Extra Challenges</h3>

<ul>
	<li><b>What does the camera see?</b>  what does the camera see?  Launch the video debug feed.  Taking a photo (can this be done just from dts, or do we need to load a program?)

	<li><b>Other Demos:</b>
</ul>

<h2>Development Pipeline:  Using Git, Docker, Containers, and Python</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>Goal:</b> Create a program, package it into a container, load on your bot, and run the program.
<p><b>Equipment needed:</b>  Department linux laptop and duckieBot.
<hr>

<h3>Overview of Software Architecture</h3>


First duckieTown programs:
Basics of programs in duckieTown:  software architecture (extra layers of containers & downloading to robots),  using git to pull down repos, set-up, how to edit, building and installing on robots (2 high-level slides (5 minutes) and then work through Jacopo’s intro (45 minutes)
Hello World: Run a program via the docker that says: Hello World (Unit C-5, Section 5.5, https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/opmanual_duckiebot/out.pdf) https://github.com/duckietown/rpi-duckiebot-simple-python/blob/master18/hello.py  Better description in Jacopo’s class notes: https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/duckietown-robotics-development/out/python_programs_environments.html
Work through:  https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/software_devel/out/ros_commands.html
First duckieTown program:  go straight for 60 centimeters (one square) and stop.
Modify to include turns:  make at least 4 turns and return to the same spot.
Write out the commands to travel the entire track (only using turning, no camera capture).
