Coding Quakes

Science Goals:  To use earthquake observations to make inferences about the earth's crust.  To be able to plot observations given the GIS location (coordinates, mapping)
Computing Goals:  To understand variables, loops, color representation, file I/O.  To introduce objects and functions, including passing parameters.


Session 1:  Drawing with Turtles
	making shapes (no loops)
	colors (from color list)
	colors from RBG
	remove drawing initials
	(move up/down to next lesson?)
	
Session 2:  Plotting Coordinates
	up/down, stamp
	dot-to-dot's
	stamping cities
	
Session 3:  Plotting Earthquake locations
	CSV data, splitting up lines
	make the earthquakes color be based on magnitude
	
Session 4:  Looping through Lists and Files
	Looping through a lists of colors
	Looping through files of colors

Session 5:  Plotting USGS data
	Add in loop through numbers and adjusting colors, instead of the first lesson that adjusts lengths 
		Have it only change blue, change it be green, change it to shades of yellow or orange as challenges
	add in adjusting colors with the magnitude-- earthquakes with smaller values will be lighter-- multiply magnitude by 25 (will never be bigger than 10)
