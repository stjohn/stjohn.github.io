		<p>
		Turtles drag a pen that traces out the path that they follow.  Sometimes that's good (when you want to draw one connected pictures), but other times, you want multiple pieces.  Try out the program below:

		</p>
		
		<p>When you want to draw different parts that are not connected, there are two useful turtle commands:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li> <tt>penup()</tt>: lifts the turtle's pen up.  The turtle will not draw until you put the pen back down.</li>
			<li> <tt>pendown()</tt>: puts the turtle's pen down.  The turtle will draw as it moves across the screen.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
		We're using these to to draw triangles to different parts of the screen (later, we will use to plot earthquakes in different parts of the world).
		We also used <b>comments</b>-- notes to ourselves to remember what we have done.  Anything after the <tt>#</tt>, the computer ignores when running the program.
