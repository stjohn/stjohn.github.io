<ul>
	<li> <b>Problem Solving & Whiteboarding:</b>  Most Wednesdays, 9:30-11am: 1001-E HN:  These are themed office hours, open to all students who wish to practice problem solving (found in programming & algorithms courses and technical interviews).  
	<li>These meet in the 1001E lab and will <b>start 11 September</b>.  <li>Since it's in the 1001E lab, no food is allowed, but you may have drinks in closed containers.   </li>
	<li> All those who attend will be expected to work in pairs or small groups during the session.
	<li> We will be using problems from <a href="https://leetcode.com">leet code</a> (free, but registration required) and <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> and roughly following <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_coding_skills_-_v6.pdf">this outline</a> for approaching problems.
	<li> To learn more and get involved with the Women in Computer Science club,
	join <a href="http://hunterwomenincs.slack.com">hunterwomenincs.slack.com</a> group or write <tt>info AT hunterwics com</tt>.

The schedule for the sessions:
<ul>
	<li> <b>11 September:</b> Introduction to whiteboarding:  philosophy, examples and rubrics.  Seven steps for acing a tech interview.
	<li> <b>18 September:</b>  Step 1:  Listen.   Identify inputs and outputs for technical questions.
	<li> <b>25 September:</b> Step 2: Clarify the question.  Ask questions to figure out what type of input and design examples that demonstrate representative (and hard) cases (clarify, repeat, example).  
	<li> <b>2 October:</b> <i> No meeting-- research travel.</i>
	<li> <b>8 October:</b> <i> No meeting-- no classes scheduled.</i>
	<li> <b>16 October:</b> <i> No meeting-- classes follow Monday schedule.</i>
	<li> <b>23 October:</b> No meeting-- outreach to middle school (piloting  science meets computing curriculum.  
	<li> <b>30 October:</b> <i> No meeting-- research travel.</i>
	<li> <b>6 November:</b> Step 3:  Functional Signature.  Translating inputs & outputs into functional notation.  Choosing names.  Top-down design.  Writing pseudocode.
	<li> <b>13 November:</b> Step 4:  Brute Force Solution & Performance.  How long does it take?  Running-time overview.
	<li> <b>20 November:</b> Step 5: Refining answers:  Bottlenecks, Unused Information, Duplicate Work.  What are the hard cases?  What information was given in the problem but not used?  Are you repeating code?
	<li> <b>27 November:</b> Step 6: Implement Solution.  Translating your pseudocode into code.
	<li> <b>4 December:</b> Step 7: Test.  What inputs would test your code?  How do you choose?
	<li> <b>11 December:</b> Putting It Altogether:  whiteboarding practice problems.
