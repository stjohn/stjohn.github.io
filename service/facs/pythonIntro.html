<h3>Warm-up:  Turtles & GIS Locations</h3>

In this section, we will use <a href="">Trinkets</a>, an on-line version of Python,
<ul>
	<li> to get started with Python and its Turtles package,
	<li> to make a world map using latitude and longitude of cities, and
	<li> to make a map of New York City with selected <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49/data">subway stops</a> from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/">NYC OpenData</a>.
</ul>

</div>


<div style="background-color: white;padding: 10px;margin: 10px;">
<h3>Turtles</h3>

<p>
We'll start by drawing shapes with the turtle library of Python. A library is an extra chunk of code, on top of what Python already has in it. Some libraries are built-in to Python, and some are designed by users which you can download separately.

<p>Click the right-facing triange (Run) button to see the program:

<p>
The program has several parts:
<ul>
	<li> It imports the <tt>turtle</tt> library, so, that its functionality can be used to draw images.
	<li> It sets up a <tt>turtle</tt>, named <tt>taylor</tt>, which is purple and turtle shaped.
	<li> It has a loop that repeats the block of indented commands 6 times.
	<li> The commands repeated move <tt>taylor</tt> forward 100 steps, stamps a turtle shape, and then turns left 60 degrees.  These are repeated since they are inside the <tt>for</tt>-loop.
</ul>

<h4>Challenges:</h4>

<p>
Try the following:
<ul>
	<li> Modify the program to make a square.
	<li> Modify the program to make an octagon (8-sided polygon) that is blue.
	<li> Make a red decagon (10-sided polygon)  with a triangle stamped on each corner.
</ul>
Harder:  write a program that makes a 5-pointed star.

<h3>World Maps</h3>

<p>We are going to use Python to make maps.  Let's start by mapping cities of the world.
Locations in the world are usually indicated by their latitude and longitude.
<ul>
	<li> <b>Latitude</b> measures the number of degrees north or south of the equator.  When written as a number, it ranges from -90 (the south pole) to +90 (the north pole).
	<li> <b>Longitude</b> measures the number of degrees east or west of the prime meridian.  When written as a number, it ranges from -180 to +180.
</ul>

We will use those ranges to be our coordinates:  (-90, -180) to (90,180).  Let's map New York City (longitude: -74, latitude: 41):

<div style = "background-color: #D0D0F0;padding: 15px;padding-top: 3px;margin: 10px">
<h4>Challenges:</h4>

<p> In the trinket above, stamp the following cities (GIS coordinates are rounded to the nearest whole number):
<ul>
	<li> Los Angeles (longitude: -118, latitude: 34),
	<li> Paris, France (longitude: 2, latitude:49),
	<li> Tokyo, Japan (longitude: 140, latitude: 35), and
	<li> Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (longitude: -43, latitude: -23).
</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div style="background-color: white;padding: 10px;margin: 10px;">

<h3>NYC Maps</h3>

<p>The same idea works for mapping at a local scale.  Here's a map with Hunter College (longitude: -73.964, latitude: 40.768):

<p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/6ad54dfceb?start=result" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Since we are working with very small differences in numbers, we wrote a separate function to convert the latitude and longitude into numbers large enough for the turtle package to use.  To plot a point with our map, we use

<pre>
	teddy.goto(scalePoints(lat,lon))
</pre>
where <tt>lat</tt> and <tt>lon</tt> are the GIS coordinates of our points.

<div style = "background-color: #D0D0F0;padding: 15px;padding-top: 3px;margin: 10px">
<h4>Challenges:</h4>

<p> In the trinket above, stamp  the following locations in different colors:
<ul>
	<li> Empire State Building (longitude: -73.985664, latitude: 40.748441).
	<li> Grand Central Terminal (longitude: -73.977229, latitude: 40.752726).
	<li> Apollo Theatre (longitude: -73.950056, latitude: 40.810018).
	<li> Lincoln Center (longitude: -73.983489, latitude: 40.772464).
</ul>
</div>

<div style="background-color: white;padding: 10px;margin: 10px;">

<h3>Mapping NYC Library Locations</h3>

<a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us">NYC Open Data</a> stores the GIS coordinates for many datasets.  For example, the location of New York City libraries is stored in a format easily read by spreadsheet programs.  The "Comma Separated Values" (CSV) files have each column separated by columns.  Here's some of the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Library/p4pf-fyc4">library CSV</a>
file from <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us">NYC Open Data</a>:

<p><img height=100 src="../openDataWeek/librariesCSV.png">

<p> The first column has the longitude and latitude of the library.  The next contains the name of the library.  Additional columns have more details about the address and location.

<p>Let's use the GIS coordinates from this OpenData file to map the 115th Street Library.  It's at (-73.95353074430393, 40.80297988196676).  Our trinket maps do not have that precision, so, we can round to:  (-73.954, 40.803) and write:
<pre>
	teddy.goto(scalePoints(-73.954, 40.803))
</pre>

<p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/6ad54dfceb?start=result" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div style = "background-color: #D0D0F0;padding: 15px;padding-top: 3px;margin: 10px">
<h4>Challenges</h4>

<p>
Stamp the locations of
<ul>
	<li> 125th Street Library,
	<li> 53rd Street Library, and
	<li> 58th Street Library
</ul>
onto a map of New York City.  The GIS coordinates are in the above image of the CSV file.
